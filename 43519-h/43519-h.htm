<p class="ac lg125">NOTE</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>In pursuance of the plan of publishing translations of valuable
  contributions to the study of the Maya hieroglyphs, the Museum Committee
  on Central American Research has the pleasure of offering the following
  translation of Dr. Ernst Förstemann's important Commentary on the Maya
  Manuscript in the Royal Library of Dresden, generally known as the
  Dresden Codex.</p>

  <p>The translation by Miss Selma Wesselhoeft and Miss A. M. Parker was
  made under the direction of Mr. Charles P. Bowditch of the Museum
  Committee.</p>

  <p>In the original German edition, published in 1901, Dr. Förstemann used
  the Arabic numerals to designate the days, but in this translation, with
  the consent of the author who has kindly revised the translation, Mr.
  Bowditch has substituted the corresponding Maya names of the days, in
  uniformity with the general use of students in this country. It is
  needless to call attention to the importance of this paper by Dr.
  Förstemann whose long-continued study of the intricate system of
  hieroglyphic writing by the ancient Mayas makes all he writes of great
  value to students engaged in this most interesting research.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">PREFACE.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Some of those who examine this book will say, that it is too early for
  a commentary on the "Dresdensis," since Maya research is yet in its
  infancy, and this opinion is certainly justified inasmuch as a final
  explanation of that remarkable monument is, of course, impossible at the
  present time. On the other hand the accounts of the numerous
  investigations and discoveries which have been made thus far are so
  isolated and so scattered in the shape of a hundred short magazine
  articles, that it is certainly desirable to have what we know and what we
  have still to learn gathered together under one head. This book is
  intended, therefore, to give an idea of the state of our knowledge in
  this department of research at this time, when the nineteenth century is
  passing into the twentieth, with the definite expectation that this work
  will soon be far outstripped and will possess an historical value
  only.</p>

  <p>The contents of the following pages are of very little value, unless
  the student can compare them with an edition of the manuscript. My first
  edition was published in 1880 at Leipsic and the second at Dresden in
  1892. The edition in Lord Kingsborough's "Mexican Antiquities" (in Volume
  III of that work, London, 1831) is still of practical use.</p>

  <p>And since in this work I must premise a knowledge of the elements of
  the subject, I would recommend, as additional aids to the comprehension
  of the following pages, my "Erläuterungen zur Mayahandschrift der
  Königlichen öffentlichen Bibliothek zu Dresden" (Dresden, 1886), and also
  Brinton, "A Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphics" (in the publications of the
  University of Pennsylvania. Series in Philology, Literature and
  Archaeology, Vol. III). I would also mention the very valuable work by
  <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>Paul Schellhas, "Die Göttergestalten der
  Mayahandschriften" (Dresden, 1897), which I follow in the designation of
  the various gods by letters of the alphabet.</p>

  <p>It need hardly be pointed out, that the numerous pioneer articles by
  Edward Seler offer abundant instruction to the student in this field as
  well as in that of Aztec remains.</p>

  <p>I wish to express heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Zelia Nuttall and Mr.
  Charles P. Bowditch, who have aided my work in various ways and have thus
  rendered possible the publication of this book.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">FIRST PART.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><b>Pages 1-45.</b></p>

  <p><b>Page 1.</b></p>

  <p>As the first page is almost entirely effaced by abrasion, we know very
  little of its contents. Like the second, however, it was doubtless
  divided into four parts. The two pages have this also in common, that,
  for lack of space, their contents are not expressed in full, but
  abbreviated as much as possible.</p>

  <p>The top section (a) of page 1 may have been filled with a sort of
  frontispiece, perhaps a face with a few signs around it.</p>

  <p>The three lower sections (b, e, d,) with the three lower of the second
  page doubtless formed a whole. Each of these sections contained a normal
  Tonalamatl of the commonest kind, which was introduced on the left by
  five day-signs having a difference of 12 and was thus divided into five
  sections of 52 days each. In sections b and d, at least, these periods
  seem to be divided into equal halves of 26 days each. In d alone we
  recognize the initial week day, VII, of the Tonalamatl. In each of the
  three divisions there were two figures of gods, but we can recognize only
  the first of these in section d as the god D.</p>

  <p><b>Page 2.</b></p>

  <p>This page contains four much abbreviated Tonalamatls. In the following
  I will represent each Tonalamatl by setting down in a vertical line those
  of the twenty days with which the principal divisions of equal length of
  the Tonalamatl begin, in a horizontal line with Roman numerals the days
  of the week of thirteen days on which the separate subdivisions begin,
  and with the Arabic numerals the distance between these days. I will also
  remark that the position of the Tonalamatls in the "Dresdensis" is not
  connected at all, as in the Aztec, with certain places in the <!-- Page
  56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span>year, and
  that no rule for this proceeding can be found. It is curious, however,
  that no Tonalamatl in this codex begins with the day IX or Eb, which is
  the more important in the last pages of the Dresden Codex.</p>

  <p><b>2a.</b></p>

  <p>This first Tonalamatl has the following form<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
<td class="pr1"> 5</td>
<td class="pr1"> V</td>
<td class="pr1"> 12</td>
<td class="pr1"> IV</td>
<td class="pr1"> 11</td>
<td class="pr1"> II</td>
<td class="pr1"> 12</td>
<td class="pr1"> I</td>
<td class="pr1"> 12</td>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">Cauac</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">Chuen</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">Akbal</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">Men</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="11">Manik.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The hieroglyphs and the figures show that preparations for a human
  sacrifice are treated of here and that the subject is, therefore, closely
  connected with page 3a, where the sacrifice itself is represented.</p>

  <p>There are but two pictures of persons, which refer, therefore, only to
  the first or to the first two subdivisions and which, for lack of space,
  are wanting for the others. On the left walks the person doomed to
  sacrifice, his arms are bound on his back, his head is barely visible and
  his eyes are apparently torn out. There is an object in front of his
  breast resembling a wreath. Behind this figure crouches a second, who
  holds an object in his hand which probably represents a rattle. The
  parallel passage in Cod. Tro. 2b shows the bound prisoner with an axe
  behind him. Then follows in Tro. 3b the prisoner without a head and
  behind him the black god with gory lance.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs&mdash;four for each of the five subdivisions&mdash;are
  arranged in the following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 1</td><td class="ar"> 2</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 5</td><td class="ar"> 6</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 9</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 13</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 17</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 3</td><td class="ar"> 4</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 7</td><td class="ar"> 8</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 10</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 14</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 18</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar" colspan="5"> 11</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 15</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 19</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar" colspan="5"> 12</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 16</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 20</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Of these 9, 13 and 17-20 are wholly effaced and 14 for the most part.
  The very first group refers to human sacrifice, for 1 is a head with an
  axe affixed to it, 2 contains the hand (<i>i</i>) which so often appears
  as the sign of grasping, especially in representations of the chase; here
  it has the same superfix as on page 22a, which on pages 4a-10a and 11a,
  b, appears as prefix. 3 is the <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>head of god H, perhaps given here as a
  symbol of wounding (serpent god?). I am unable to explain the meaning of
  the dot between two crosses in front of this head; perhaps the sign
  denotes the day Kan, which is here arrived at by calculation. We find the
  same hieroglyph on page 3. Sign 4 signifies the death-god A = Cimi, who
  appears again in 12.</p>

  <p>In like manner 2 is repeated in 6 and 14. 7, 11 and 15 (probably also
  19) are, however, the familiar cross <i>b</i>; 8 is the head of E with a
  prefixed knife; the intention here may have been to show that human
  sacrifice would be likely to have an auspicious influence upon the
  harvest. 10 and 16 are another unknown head. In 5 we see the familiar
  Kan-Imix sign, which, for the present, I am inclined to regard as
  denoting a feast or a sacrificial meal.</p>

  <p><b>2b&mdash;c.</b></p>

  <p>These two sections have something in common. First, 2b (as also 2d) is
  divided into but two parts and 2c into only three parts. Second, in 2b
  and 2c the scribe intended to draw the hieroglyphs for 10 days each,
  instead of 5 each, but only drew the outlines of the second five, since
  they could not be used for these Tonalamatls. Third, the persons
  represented here are all engaged in the same occupation, each holding in
  his hands an object which looks like a frame for a net or web, and also a
  large needle with an eye through which a thread has been passed.</p>

  <p>A very similar representation is found in the Codex Troano 34a, 33a
  and 23*c, and also in the Sahagun Manuscript of the Bibliotheca
  Laurentiana at Florence. This can hardly mean anything else than the
  knotting of cords, which was the only method of casting lots current
  among the Mayas; compare Seler, "Altmexikanische Studien II" (1899), p.
  31, and "Zauberei im alten Mexiko" (1900), p. 90, by the same author.
  This clearly indicates the use of these Tonalamatls in soothsaying.</p>

  <p>Fourth and last, each of the five hieroglyph groups of 2b and 2c begin
  with the same sign, which must, therefore, denote the casting of lots.
  <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page58"></a>{58}</span></p>

  <p>The Tonalamatl 2b runs thus<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> XI</td>
<td class="pr1"> 34</td>
<td class="pr1"> VI</td>
<td class="pr1"> 18</td>
<td class="pr1"> XI</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Oc</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ik</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ix</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Cimi</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ezanab.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The pictures are of three persons. At the left two sit facing one
  another and at the right is the god A. Of the first two, the one at the
  left is probably feminine, but with an old face. I am inclined here, in
  spite of the sex, to recall the bald-headed old god (N, according to
  Schellhas), whom I am inclined to consider, for the present, the
  representative of the 5 Uayeyab days at the end of the year. This would
  account for the sign resembling an 8 lying on its side, which appears on
  the god's head and which usually represents the change of the year
  (compare pages 38a, 41b, 52b, 68a and 72c). I cannot explain the person
  sitting facing this god further, than that from his hieroglyph he is
  either H or allied to H.</p>

  <p>Of the 8 hieroglyphs</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 1</td><td class="ar"> 2</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 5</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 6</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 3</td><td class="ar"> 4</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 7</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 8</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>the first, as stated, seems to refer to the casting of lots, 2 is the
  sign for H, 3 denotes the female figure pictured beneath it, and 4 is the
  sign <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik on top of it. In the second group 5 is the
  same as 1, 6 is the cross <i>b</i>, and 7 and 8 are the hieroglyphs for
  A.</p>

  <p>2c contains the following Tonalamatl<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> III</td>
<td class="pr1"> 20</td>
<td class="pr1"> X</td>
<td class="pr1"> 17</td>
<td class="pr1"> I</td>

<tr><td colspan="7">Ik</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="7">Ix</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="7">Cimi</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="7">Ezanab.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>There are illustrations for only the first two of the three
  subdivisions; the two figures composing them are engaged in the
  occupation mentioned under 2b. At the left sits a deity, who is probably
  E, whose head develops into a second, which is that of an animal; on the
  right sits the god D.</p>

  <p>The three groups of four hieroglyphs each are arranged as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 1</td><td class="ar"> 2</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 5</td><td class="ar"> 6</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 3</td><td class="ar"> 4</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 7</td><td class="ar"> 8</td><td class="pr0 pl2 ar"> 10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0 pl2 ar" colspan="5"> 11</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr0 pl2 ar" colspan="5"> 12</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>{59}</span></p>

  <p>Of these hieroglyphs 1, 5 and 9 are the head already numbered 1 and 5
  on 2b; 2, 6 and 10 are the cross <i>b</i>; 3, 7 and 11 are three
  different heads, all, as it seems, having the Akbal sign, and 11 having
  also the numeral 6. 4 is again (see 5 on 2a above) the Kan-Imix sign, 8 a
  Kin with suffix (the east?) and the numeral 16 as prefix; finally 12 is
  Cimi (A). Do the numbers 16 and 6 refer to the 16th and 6th of the 17 and
  15 days standing below them? The beginning of this Tonalamatl III Oc
  seems to me to fall on an especially auspicious day (hieroglyph
  <i>a</i>).</p>

  <p>2d has the following Tonalamatl<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
<td class="pr1"> 28</td>
<td class="pr1"> II</td>
<td class="pr1"> 24</td>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Lamat</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ahau</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Eb</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Kan</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Cib.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>This refers probably to the section devoted to women, pages 13-23. For
  the picture on the left is a woman sitting and holding an unknown object
  in one hand; on her right stands the death-god A holding in his hands
  what may be an apron or breech-clout; there is a similar representation
  in Cod. Tro. 29*b.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs are</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar"> 1</td><td class="ar"> 2</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 5</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 6</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar"> 3</td><td class="ar"> 4</td><td class="pl2 ar"> 7</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 8</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Of these 1, 6 and 8 are one of the signs of A, 7 another, and 4 may be
  a third, recalling the Moan, which, as on page 14c, rests on a hand held
  beneath it. 2 and 5 seem to signify a carpet or other fabric (or a
  lying-in bed?), on the one hand suggesting the occupation of the figures
  in 2b and 2c, and on the other the checkered hieroglyph, which is so
  common in the Palenque inscriptions. Finally 3 is the woman pictured
  beneath.</p>

  <p><b>Page 3.</b></p>

  <p>We come now to the sacrificial scene proper, which practically fills
  the upper half of the page. The victim, a woman, lies bound hand and
  foot, on the sacrificial stone, just as in the Cortes. 41-42; the
  incision above the stomach is already made and the eyes are closed.
  Behind her rises the tree of life with a bird (vulture?) sitting in its
  branches, which holds in its bill one end of an object, resembling a
  ribbon (entrails) issuing from the eyes of the victim, just as in Tro.
  26*a and 27*a. <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span></p>

  <p>This picture is surrounded by four gods, who, however, differ very
  much from the other four in the second sacrificial scene, page 34a. At
  the right above is K, who, I think, is the storm-god; the figure at the
  left above is almost entirely destroyed, and its hieroglyph wholly; I
  prefer to consider it a rain deity, so that these two gods shall signify
  the productive season. The two gods below may refer to the blessing upon
  the harvest and chase resulting from the season and the sacrifice. For,
  at the left below, we see the maize deity E, holding a dish of fruit,
  while her head-ornament contains a second head. At the right below sits
  the serpent deity H and in front of him is an animal with the noose still
  around its neck, with which it was caught.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs are in the following order<span

  <p>Of these, 1-5 are wholly effaced and also the most essential part of
  6.</p>

  <p>Of these hieroglyphs four (1-4, 13-16, 17-20 and 21-24) clearly belong
  to each of the four deities, for 15, 18, and 22 (the last again with the
  dot between two crosses as on page 2a) certainly belong to the picture.
  From this it seems to follow that Hieroglyphs 5 to 12 refer to the
  sacrifice itself. As a matter of fact 9 and 11, which are directly above
  the sacrifice, also refer particularly to that part of the
  representation.</p>

  <p>I wish also to call special attention to the two signs 8 and 16 which
  seem to correspond to one another. They are the two which I have
  designated with <i>q</i> and <i>a</i>, which are met with here for the
  first time (aside from the <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik, which is not in
  question here) and which, I think, denote the good and evil days,
  <i>q</i> referring to the sacrifice and <i>a</i> to its results.</p>

  <p>In regard to the rest of these hieroglyphs, 7 and 9 are Cimi; 10, 14,
  17 and 24 the cross <i>b</i> and 11 and 23 the hieroglyph <i>c</i>. 12 is
  the head with the Akbal eye, having for its prefix the uplifted arm,
  which is joined thus to the most diverse signs, and which also occurs in
  the Tro-Cort. 13 is a similar head, 19 again <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>Imix, 20 the sign
  <i>o</i> and 21 a hieroglyph, which is without doubt a simplified
  head.</p>

  <p>Here, too, we have a Tonalamatl, and one beginning on an especially
  ceremonial day I Ahau, which seems to play the same role in celestial
  affairs as IV Ahau does in terrestrial matters. On the sacrificial stone
  we read the days Ahau, Eb, Kan, Cib and Lamat, and I think it likely that
  the same days occur in the passage of the Cortes. referred to above; the
  passage evidently contains some errors. The subdivisions of this
  Tonalamatl are not known to us, for here the manuscript is somewhat
  confused. I propose to read it as follows<span

  <p>Either reading is dubious. The scribe divided the lower half of page 3
  into two parts, and drew in each the outline of five days; but then he
  saw that, to continue his work, he needed a long surface extending from
  left to right, and he therefore omitted filling in these two
  sections.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 4a&mdash;10a.</b></p>

  <p>We have here a normal Tonalamatl, which, however, was evidently meant
  by the author to serve a very special purpose, since he divided the first
  section of 52 days into no less than 20 parts of 2, 3 or 4 days. I give
  the following arrangement here, remarking, at the same time, that in one
  doubtful case (between the third and fourth groups) I deviate from my
  former plan<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Since the five sections on page 4a begin with the days Imix, Ben,

  <p>Now, however, in the "Globus," Vol. LXXIII, in my two articles

  there is good reason to believe that the scribe has made a grave mistake
  here.</p>

  <p>I assume that the scribe simply transferred the so-called month days
  from the year just past to the year in which he was writing, in doing
  which they were, of course, moved five days on (since 365 = 20 × 18 + 5),
  but he did not bear in mind, that the pictures and the hieroglyphs could
  then no longer correspond. Hence the days must be not</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the 20 groups, disregarding the first (really
  zero) which has no figure and no hieroglyphs. We will leave out of the
  question also the first two hieroglyphs of each group, which are the same
  twenty times and form, as it were, merely a superscription, in which the
  first sign is a head, also occurring elsewhere (4b-5b), with suffix and
  affix, and the second is the hieroglyph <i>i</i>, which might readily
  denote a sacrifice. Thus only the usual four signs remain for each
  picture.</p>

  <p>1. Day 15 = Ezanab; Aztec Tecpatl, flint, lance point. The figure of
  the god does not correspond with this at all; it is a god in a gala
  cloak, holding before him a serpent and bearing a quetzal bird on his
  back. This figure, which resembles none other in our manuscript, strongly
  recalls Kukulcan, who, in fact, is often placed by the scribes at the
  head of the 20 Maya gods (cf. Dres. 36) in which manner he appears in
  this place quite without reference to the day and the hieroglyphs. In
  this interpretation I follow Seler, in the main, who in his treatise
  "Quetzalcouatl-Kukulcan in Yucatan" (1898) expresses this opinion on page
  403 of the separate edition. But possibly the ear-ornament may refer to
  Ezanab. Of the <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>hieroglyphs, 1 and 2 are the familiar sign
  of the serpent deities H or I, though here they are not drawn exactly
  alike. They also appear together on page 6a. 3 ( = <i>r</i>) I think is
  the sign for the week of 13 days, which recurs in groups 5, 11, 14 and
  16, and hence is distributed 4 times, though not regularly, among the 4 ×
  13 days. Sign 4 is the death bird.</p>

  <p>2. Day 19 = Ik; Aztec Ehecatl, wind, air, breath. The deity pictured
  is B, the god who is found the most frequently, and with the most varied
  attributes, of all the gods in our manuscript. He is the god proper of
  breathing and living and was, perhaps, the local god in the region where
  this manuscript originated. The second hieroglyph is his sign; the first,
  with a prefixed 9, is <i>p</i> the third <i>q</i> and the fourth <i>a</i>
  with the usual 3 before it; their relations to B are still unknown.</p>

  <p>3. Day 3 = Cimi; Aztec Miquiztli, death. The deity with a black line
  about the mouth is certainly the bald-headed old god N, whom we shall
  find on pages 12c, 14b, 17a, 21c, and 37a. His hands are much deformed;
  perhaps indicating the bite of a serpent? Of the hieroglyphs, 1, 2 and 4
  are effaced; 3 is surely the sign of the god, differing, it is true, from
  his usual hieroglyph, but recurring with a 4 also on pages 21c and 24.
  This 4 might refer to the four kinds of years, but here, perhaps, to the
  fourth of the five Uayeyab days, and would thus agree with the 24th day
  of Cumku, which should lie here (in the year 9 Kan), if I have begun the
  Tonalamatl correctly.</p>

  <p>4. Day 4 = Manik; Aztec Mazatl. The significance is stag or roe, game
  or the chase. The first picture on page 5 is one of the forms of F, which
  seems to stand here not merely for human sacrifice, but also for war and
  the chase, and especially for the act of killing in general. Of the
  hieroglyphs, unfortunately only the fourth can be read in full (the sign
  <i>c</i>), the upper part of the second is the cross <i>b</i> and the
  lower part the sign Ahau; the number 11, which is peculiar to the god F,
  probably stood before the second sign. Did this god rule the eleventh of
  the 13 months of 28 days, as Moan ruled the thirteenth? <!-- Page 64
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

  <p>5. Day 8 = Chuen; Aztec Ozomatli, ape, then probably the constellation
  of Ursa Minor, and hence belonging to the god C. The figure is
  unquestionably his, and the first hieroglyph is surely his sign. The
  other three are the familiar <i>a</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>r</i>.</p>

  <p>6. Day 10 = Ben; Aztec Acatl, the fundamental significance of which is
  reed, rush, etc. The connection between this day and the god B pictured
  here must be left undecided. Of the hieroglyphs, the first points rather
  to the sun-god G, the second, with the numeral 7 as a prefix, is entirely
  destroyed, the third is the sign <i>u</i>, and the fourth, which is half
  obliterated, was <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>7. Day 12 = Men; Aztec Quauhtli, eagle. The figure to which the first
  hieroglyph with the numeral 11 belongs, is a form of the god F, but has
  the nose-ornament of the sun-god G. Hieroglyph 2, which we shall find
  again on 22c, may refer especially to the eagle; the third is the sign of
  the day Caban with a prefixed 3, and the fourth is the sign <i>o</i>.</p>

  <p>8. Day 16 = Cauac; Aztec Quiahuitl. The meaning in the different
  languages points to rain, storm and summer, of which the tortoise and
  serpent are special symbols. I shall not venture to decide positively
  upon the deity pictured here; perhaps the object in his hand may be a
  tortoise; Seler, "Quetzalcouatl-Kukulcan" (1898), p. 403, calls him the
  young god. In the hieroglyphs we find the serpent sign Chicchan twice,
  just as in the first group on page 4; then follow <i>a</i> and
  Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>9. Day 18 = Imix; Aztec Cipactli. In my treatise on the day-gods, I
  have referred to the variations in the significance of this day. The
  Mayas connected with it the idea of the female breast, of drink, and, in
  particular, of the intoxicating beverage pulque. The deity pictured here,
  which is certainly a female deity, has a kind of vessel in her hand, from
  which the serpent resting on her head appears to be drinking. Hieroglyphs
  2 and 4 are wholly obliterated, and 1 partly; there is a lock of hair,
  the sign of femininity, before 1 and 3. It is to be noted further that 3
  is the sign of the death-god and that the deity pictured here has the
  death-sign on its cheek. Can this possibly suggest deathlike
  intoxication? <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

  <p>10. Day 20 = Akbal; Aztec Calli. The meaning is that of darkness,
  night, dark hole, then that of house as an artificial cave or as a place
  of shelter at night. The first picture on page 7, the black deity L with
  the beard fits admirably here. The black paint still visible proves that
  the first hieroglyph, which is almost effaced, was his sign, and the
  second may be a head more definitely identifying him. The third was the
  sign <i>q</i>, the fourth is an Ahau, perhaps intimating that Akbal
  belonged to the days beginning the Uinal sections of 20 days, and to the
  lords of the same. In addition to appearing with these 5th, 10th, 15th,
  and 20th days, an Ahau is found with the 1st, 6th, 11th and 16th as
  regent of the year, and lastly, but especially, with the 17th, which
  bears the name Ahau, and with the god D belonging to it.</p>

  <p>11. Day 2 = Chicchan; Aztec Cohuatl, serpent. With this would agree
  also the third and fourth hieroglyphs (the latter <i>r</i>), which are
  the two we found in the first representation on page 4 belonging to the
  deity holding the serpent. But what is the meaning here of the dog-head
  of the figure, and of the first two hieroglyphs corresponding to it? And
  what does this creature hold in its hand? The lightning? The hieroglyphs
  seem to correspond to the seventh day, as if the scribe had recognized
  his mistake and referred here to the present and not to the past
  year.</p>

  <p>12. Day 6 = Muluc; Aztec Atl, water, cloud. With this corresponds the
  image of the storm deity K and his two hieroglyphs 1 and 2, the first of
  which occurs frequently, and the second is found on pages 20 b and 47,
  while 3 (Ahau) designates the day as regent of the year and 4 is the
  hieroglyph <i>a</i>. The curious sign 2 is also given on Cort. 32 b.</p>

  <p>13. Day 8 = Chuen; Aztec Ozomatli, ape. There is no agreement at all
  here, but everything points to the day 3 lying 5 days back, the picture
  of the Cimi as well as the hieroglyphs, even the third with the Akbal
  sign and the uplifted arm (as on page 36a), also the fourth (<i>c</i>)
  which is generally thought to be the death-bird. It even seems here as if
  the scribe had had the <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page66"></a>{66}</span>preceding year in mind; possibly he did not
  want to repeat the fifth group.</p>

  <p>14. Day 11 = Ix; Aztec Ocelotl, jaguar. Here there is an admirable
  correspondence between the figure and the first hieroglyph, which on page
  26, top, also refers to the jaguar represented there; the other three
  hieroglyphs are <i>r</i>, Kan-Imix and <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>15. Day 13 = Cib; Aztec Cozcaquauhtli, vulture. The bird is actually
  pictured here and its sign is the first hieroglyph; the third is
  <i>q</i>, the second and fourth are obliterated.</p>

  <p>16. Day 16 = Cauac; Aztec Quiahuitl, meaning, as in the eighth group,
  rain, storm, summer. The figure, the first on page 9, seems, however, to
  indicate the day Ahau, as does also the second hieroglyph, which is Ahau;
  the first and third are effaced and the fourth is <i>r</i>. Perhaps the
  scribe did not wish to repeat the eighth group.</p>

  <p>17. Day 18 = Imix; Aztec Cipactli, as in the ninth group. Here the
  allusion to pulque is still plainer than it is there. The picture is that
  of a woman with bound eyes and uncertain position of the hands, and here
  too with the death-sign, and on her head a bee from whose honey the
  beverage was prepared. I shall not venture to explain the first two
  hieroglyphs; the second with uplifted arm appears again on page 8c. The
  third is Cimi and the fourth <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>18. Day 1 = Kan; Aztec Cuetzpalin, denoting maize with the Mayas. The
  representation consists of the maize deity with the Kan sign on her head,
  the first hieroglyph is hers, then follows Kan-Imix, which I am inclined
  to interpret as meaning a meal, next the sign <i>a</i> and finally a
  head, which is uncommon and undetermined, with the leaf-shaped prefix as
  on pages 4c, 6c, 9c, 34b, 61a, 67b and 69a.</p>

  <p>19. Day 3 = Cimi; Aztec Miquiztli, death. The first figure on page 10
  is a deity with the head of the death-bird Moan and above the head is the
  death-sign. As has long been known, the first and third hieroglyphs
  unquestionably belong to this god, also the fourth with the Akbal sign
  agrees with it, and the second likewise recalls the Moan. <!-- Page 67
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span></p>

  <p>20. Day 5 = Lamat; Aztec Tochtli, meaning rabbit in the latter
  language. Neither the figure, which represents Cimi, death, nor the
  corresponding hieroglyphs, excepting the second one agree with this day.
  This second hieroglyph has both in front and above it the number 6. Two
  numbers added thus to the common Uinal sign usually designate the Uinal
  period plus days, as is so very common on the inscriptions, so that the
  sign appearing here would denote 6 × 20 + 6 = 126 days. The hieroglyph
  here, however, is <i>not</i> the usual sign for 20 days. On the contrary,
  it has in the centre a straight line and on either side of it a parallel
  line ending in a little knob (or loop?). I propose to regard these lines
  as representing the ecliptic and the moon, which takes its course now to
  the north and now to the south of the ecliptic, and the sign as a whole
  as signifying the lunar month of 28 days. This is confirmed on pages 51,
  55, 56 and 57. In that case this hieroglyph would denote 6 × 28 + 6 = 174
  days.</p>

  <p>Now bear in mind that in this passage the day X Lamat, which equals
  the Aztec Tochtli, is referred to.</p>

  <p>In the year named after this day, and indeed on the 174th day of the
  same (1 Cipactli), in February 1502, the emperor Ahuitzotzin died;
  compare especially Brinton, "Essays of an Americanist" (1890), pp.
  274-283.</p>

  <p>Should this association in our manuscript of Cimi = death, X Tochtli
  and the numeral 174, be considered accidental? Or did the scribe, writing
  in the year after the event, actually record it in the year 1503 and,
  departing from his real subject, immortalize it in this place at the end
  of the greatest Tonalamatl? I will not refrain from expressing the
  conjecture I have long entertained, though I am quite prepared for
  differences of opinion.</p>

  <p>Seler attempts to explain this series of 20 gods in another way; see
  his "Monumente von Copan und Quirigua" (1899), p. 729. (Cf. his collected
  papers p. 781.)</p>

  <p><b>Pages 4b&mdash;5b.</b></p>

  <p>It is my opinion that the Tonalamatl just now discussed connects with
  another, which is recorded directly below the <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>beginning of the first,
  and which also differs from all the other ordinary Tonalamatls. It
  likewise divides the first 52 days into a large number of small parts
  (14) and has the following form, if we adopt Seler's correction in the
  last member<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The two days Ik and Oc should be read Oc and Ik. There is only one
  picture here:&mdash;a scaly green monster with the head of the principal
  god D. There are six hieroglyphs on its body, the first is that of Eb and
  the second that of Cimi, the fourth is the sign <i>c</i>. The others I
  shall not venture to determine.</p>

  <p>According to a conjecture expressed verbally by Dieseldorff, this
  figure may represent the god who continually recreates himself. We are
  reminded here of the two-headed serpent (Seler, "Tonalamatl der
  Aubinschen Sammlung," 1900, pp. 65-66). There are two rows of hieroglyphs
  above the monster, the upper contains 8 and the second 6, but the second
  hieroglyph in the upper row belongs in the lower. Thus there are 14
  hieroglyphs corresponding to the subdivisions noted above.</p>

  <p>The upper seven signs are all alike and are also identical with the
  one, which, in the great Tonalamatl, recorded above, begins the heading
  of all the 20 groups; this likewise points to a close connection between
  the two Tonalamatls.</p>

  <p>The remaining 7 hieroglyphs should be considered as only 6, for it is
  improbable that C occurs twice in this series. They are the gods D, C, H,
  N, A and B, to which perhaps an E or F or G is to be mentally added in
  place of the second C. They are all principal gods with the exception of
  N (as always, according to Schellhas's nomenclature). This N, an old man,
  denotes, as it seems, the five Uayeyab days at the end of the year, as he
  does also on page 21c. This sign with the number 4 has already been seen
  on page 4a. If in 4b this sign signifies the last day of the year, then
  this Tonalamatl falls in the year XIII Kan. The sign 5 Zac also appears
  in the Tro-Cort., <i>e.g.</i>, Cort. 29 c, Tro. 9*b and 28*b.</p>

  <p>Now I shall proceed to examine all that has not yet been <!-- Page 69
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>discussed to the
  end of page 12, taking up first the remainder of sections a and b and
  then all those of 4c-12c.</p>

  <p>The period of 52 days is thus divided into five sections of 12 and 8
  days each, alternating regularly. A deity and four hieroglyphs belong to
  each of these sections, viz<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. D sitting, with his right hand pointing upward and his left
  downward; on his head is the Akbal sign as on page 15c. The hieroglyphs
  are destroyed with the exception of the third, which is the sign of D
  (Ahau). The fact that the 12 days happen to end with the day belonging to
  D (Ahau) is accidental.</p>

  <p>2. R, a human figure with the head of the Moan (as on page 7c and 10a)
  and with the copal pouch around his neck. Of the hieroglyphs only the
  fourth, one of the common signs of Moan (<i>c</i>), is legible.</p>

  <p>3. H, or, according to Seler, "the young god," as on 12b and 14b, with
  nose-peg and copal pouch. On his (her?) head sits a bird with an object,
  which I do not recognize, in its bill; compare page 12b. Of the
  hieroglyphs, the first is destroyed, the second is the unmistakable sign
  of H, the fourth is the common <i>a</i>, and the third I cannot as yet
  decipher.</p>

  <p>4. A, with the usual design issuing from his mouth (the expiring
  breath of life?). Of the hieroglyphs, the first is a double Manik with
  prefixes, which probably denotes violent death; the other three are very
  common symbols of A.</p>

  <p>5. E, holding a vessel containing plants (agave?) and with the cross
  <i>b</i> on his head-ornament. The first hieroglyph is an unexplained
  compound design apparently referring to the Moan, an Imix and two

  Imix-Kan, designates as dispensing nourishment, and the fourth, Ahau, as
  a leading deity.</p>

  insufficient space in the top section. He, therefore, condensed two

  that the period of 52 days was divided, for the sake of brevity, into

  <p>are sufficient for the two figures one expects to see here; but they
  are, in fact, intended for four figures&mdash;two for each of the two
  Tonalamatls. For the first of the two Tonalamatls we have only one
  figure, God K, who, however, from the dish held in his hand, probably
  containing honey (compare 10b), seems to stand here also in place of E.
  In agreement with this, Hieroglyph 2 and probably also 1 (<i>s</i>, which
  occurs again on page 13a, and also on page 10b) refers to K, while 3
  clearly refers to E and 4 is the sign <i>a</i>. Hieroglyphs 5-8 belong to
  the second of the two Tonalamatls. The first two of these hieroglyphs,
  which are entirely erased, refer to an unknown deity, and the last two
  unquestionably relate to A.</p>

  <p>These four parts, however, form a whole, inasmuch as they all relate
  to making fire, as it is also represented in the Troano 6, 19 and 14*c.
  Hence the upper row of hieroglyphs contains signs which are repeated. 1,
  5 and 9 are the same head, the last two cases have the sign for darkness
  (Akbal); this Akbal appears again in the parallel passages of the Tro.
  and in 13 it is somewhat enlarged simply owing to the absence of a head.
  The act of making fire seems to be denoted here rather by the second sign
  (2, 6, 10, 14), which I designate by <i>k</i> and which, originally,
  doubtless consisted of two hands (double Manik sign); the prefix is the
  same in 6 and 14, and different in 2 and 10.</p>

  <p>The eight lower hieroglyphs are merely the monograms of the four gods
  making the fire. The first deity is F, the second either A or one of the
  black deities L or M, the third D and the fourth apparently F again, but
  conceived as feminine. In the third picture there is a second object,
  apparently a head (of D?), below the piece of wood in which the
  fire-stick is being whirled. Hieroglyph 11 belonging to this deity has an
  Akbal as a prefix.</p>

  <p>This Tonalamatl is divided, by way of exception, into four equal
  parts, which all begin with the same week day X.</p>

  <p>Here too, as in the preceding Tonalamatl, there are four subdivisions,
  and also 16 hieroglyphs arranged in the same way. And here too the upper
  line is a condensation of the whole, the same two signs being repeated
  four times. The first of these is <i>q</i>, which is still a problem and
  which occurs inverted also on Cort. 20d-21d (where there are figures with
  bird-heads); there too it is the characteristic hieroglyph. The second,
  however, is again the double Manik sign referring to activity of some
  kind, as in the preceding Tonalamatl. But the occupation of the four
  deities represented here is of very different kinds and altogether
  problematical. E, conceived as feminine, occupies the first place, with a
  Kan sign on her head and holding in her hand a vessel exactly like <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span>the one
  held by the figure just above on the same page. The third hieroglyph is
  hers and the fourth is the sign <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>The second figure is A with a hook-shaped object hanging around his
  neck. His hands also seem to be deformed, as are those of the third and
  fifth figures of the great Tonalamatl (on pages 4 and 5). His two
  hieroglyphs are among those usually belonging to him.</p>

  <p>The third god is D sitting, by way of exception, on some object
  (stone?). Something resembling the pestle of an ordinary mortar is
  hanging down in front of his headdress, and he is holding a very similar
  object to his mouth. His two hieroglyphs are also those which usually
  refer to him.</p>

  <p>The most striking figure is that of the fourth god, whom I do not
  recognize. He seems to be attracting to himself a bird flying down from
  above, whose bill almost touches his mouth. His hieroglyph has the sign
  Yax (strength) for a prefix and the fourth hieroglyph is <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>Again we have a Tonalamatl divided into equal parts, this time,
  however, into but two, and it seems thus to be closely connected with the
  preceding.</p>

  <p>While hitherto four hieroglyphs have usually belonged to each figure,
  we find here ten in all and in the following order<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

  <p>There are two figures here, which stand in some relation to one
  another,&mdash;two persons sitting facing each other. The one at the left
  is certainly D, the one at the right can hardly be the old woman, whom
  Schellhas designates with O, but rather N, the old god of the Uayeyab
  days. The former seems to be about to take something from the hand of the
  latter. I surmise that it is one of the prophetic weaving implements.
  <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>which we found on page 2. The two
  hieroglyphs <i>e</i> and <i>h</i> must refer to this; they are repeated,
  as usual, in the two groups, <i>e</i> in places 2 and 8, and <i>h</i> in
  1 and 6.</p>

  <p>Signs 3 and 4 refer unquestionably to D and hence 5 and 7 (the first
  <i>q</i> with Ben-Ik, and the latter unknown) must be the designation of
  the person sitting on the right. We shall meet the latter sign again on
  pages 15b and 18a, with the same person, and on pages 27a and 39b with
  entirely different persons. Sign 7 is an object, which also appears on
  15b and 18a, held in the hands of women and may denote some special
  sacrificial offering; on 9b Kan-Imix appears in place of this sign, and
  on 39b beside it. It should be noted that sign 7 stands here in exactly
  the same proximity to 1 and 6 as on page 27a.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs 9 and 10 stand outside the two groups, and since, as
  we know, they belong to the god A, this prophecy must concern death, as
  is more clearly indicated by the corresponding hieroglyphs on page
  9b.</p>

  <p><b>Page 9b.</b></p>

  <p>Here, for the first time in this manuscript, we have a Tonalamatl in
  which the 260 days are not divided into five fifths of 52 days each, but
  into four quarters of 65 days. This may be represented as follows, if we
  supply the III, which is wanting at the beginning<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> III</td>
<td class="pr1"> 33</td>

</tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Muluc</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ix</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Cauac</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Kan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>In the first place, the close connection of this Tonalamatl with that
  recorded on page 8b, just now discussed, is striking, for</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>1. Here too we find a division into two equal parts is intended, but
  which, of course, as the number is 65, cannot be mathematically
  exact.</p>

  <p>2. Here too we not only find 10 hieroglyphs, but we find them in the
  same order as on page 8b, and here too the sign <i>e</i> stands in places
  2 and 8, and <i>h</i> in 1 and 6; again 3, 4 and 9 are exactly the same
  hieroglyphs here as there, so that only 5, 7 and 10 are different. <!--
  Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>{74}</span></p>

  <p>3. The picture is again that of two persons sitting facing each other.
  Here D sits on the right and facing him is the grain deity E. D is
  speaking to E as is indicated by the sign before his face and by the
  position of his right hand. The signs belonging to E are Hieroglyphs 5
  and 7, while those of D are 3 and 4. It seems, therefore, that D is
  announcing to E the prophecy contained in the preceding Tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>4. Two hieroglyphs, 9 and 10, are again added, both relating to
  death&mdash;9 to god A and 10 to F.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now what especially distinguishes this passage from the preceding one,
  is the fact that the four days are the so-called regents of the year,
  Muluc, Ix, Cauac and Kan, above which, perhaps to emphasize this
  circumstance, there is a particularly elaborate Ahau. Seler ("Einiges
  mehr über die Monumente von Copan und Quiriguá," p. 210), however, thinks
  that this sign is the hieroglyph for the numeral three, which should
  stand here.</p>

  <p>The fact that the tenth sign, which is the last, is 13 Moan in the
  preceding Tonalamatl, while here it is 11 F, will be of special
  significance in deciding the interpretation.</p>

  <p><b>Page 10b.</b></p>

  <p>The manuscript gives the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
<td class="pr1"> 22</td>
<td class="pr1"> III</td>
<td class="pr1"> 22</td>
<td class="pr1"> </td>
</tr>

<tr><td colspan="5">Ik</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ix</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Cimi</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="5">Ezanab.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>This cannot be correct, for 22 + 22 is not 52, and from XIII to III is
  not 22 days, while the last Roman numeral is wanting. I, therefore,
  propose to make a 6 of the numeral 2, which occurs twice, by changing the
  lower dot into a line, and to change the III into a XIII by the addition
  of two lines. This gives the series the form XIII 26 XIII 26 XIII. Then
  by its division into three equal parts, this Tonalamatl accords with the
  three preceding ones, which it also resembles in other respects. For here
  too we find two persons pictured; this time, however, they do not face
  each other, but are placed one behind the other. The first is B, the god
  of life strictly speaking, the second is F, who is represented by his
  hieroglyph in the preceding <!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page75"></a>{75}</span>Tonalamatl, and who is the god of the chase
  and probably of death by violence. Both hold offerings in their hands,
  which have been presented to them, and this also seems to be suggested by
  the two pendent copal pouches. The dish in B's hand probably contains
  honey, while F holds a plant (agave?)&mdash;the very same articles, which
  we find on page 12a in the hands of other gods. It looks as if the gods
  had been propitiated and as if this were the conclusion of a drama
  running through four Tonalamatls. Again the two death-hieroglyphs, which
  were added on pages 8 and 9, are wanting here, and we find only the usual
  eight signs<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

</table>

  <p>Of these, 1, 2 and 5, 6 are the usual comprehensive heading; 1 and 5
  are the Manik sign, which must denote the offering, while 2 and 6 are the
  characters, which perhaps, not incorrectly, has been thought to denote a
  repetition, a kind of plural; we have already seen it on pages 12a-13a. 3
  is the monogram of B, yet it looks more like a fist with the thumb
  prominent&mdash;a figure I have frequently found in the inscriptions of
  Palenque. It must also refer to the sacrifice offered to B, which is
  confirmed by the <i>a</i> added to it in 4 and probably denoting a good
  day. 7 is the hieroglyph of F to which the sign in 8 corresponds, while
  the prefixed arm in 8 seems to refer to the presentation of the
  sacrifice.</p>

  <p>This section seems to refer chiefly to the harvest. First the Muluc
  sign with suffix and affix, which is repeated in 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17 at
  regular intervals, suggests rain as a preliminary condition of the
  harvest. Next in 2 the hieroglyph of K, the wind-god, is added to this
  Muluc sign, and K is the patron of the day Muluc. Then the signs <i>a</i>
  and <i>o</i> follow in 3 and 4. There is no picture belonging to this
  group; it ought to be the god K. The second group adds to the Muluc in 6
  the glyph of the sun, which is the second preliminary condition of the
  harvest. This is followed in 7 by the sign <i>u</i> apparently denoting
  wind and cloud and having the prefix of the storm-god, and in 8 is the
  sign, which, strange to say, stands also in the last Tonalamatl in the
  eighth place. I am not very clear in regard to this sign. The sun-god G
  with copal pouch and a vessel containing grains of maize is appropriately
  represented with this group. With equal fitness the third group contains
  E, the harvest-god proper, with copal pouch and grains of maize, and, as
  usual, a Kan sign on his head, but also with a parrot, probably as an
  enemy of the harvest. Sign 10 is E's hieroglyph, to which, as is so often
  the case, sign 11 (Imix-Kan) is added and in 12 the double Manik
  (<i>i</i>). The last two groups are without figures of deities; the
  double Manik (14 and 18), possibly a repeated summons to sacrifice, is
  common to both groups. There seems here to be a further reference to the
  <i>enemies</i> of the harvest, for 15 is the hieroglyph of the vulture,
  16 that of the death-bird and 19 that of the night-god, after which this
  section closes with the quite universal sign <i>a</i>. If space had
  permitted, the vulture and the night-god would have been represented
  here.</p>

  <p>This is again a regular arrangement, half of the 52 days being in the
  middle and a quarter each at the beginning and end.</p>

  <p>The first four days refer to the purport of the prediction, Ix, the
  tiger, Cimi, death, Ezanab, the wounding lance point, and Oc, the
  lightning dog. The 12 hieroglyphs indicate the <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span>connection with the
  foregoing Tonalamatl, for 1, 5 and 9 contain the same Muluc sign which we
  found there in the same places.</p>

  <p>The three figures, it seems to me, signify the approach of death, the
  wound occasioning death, and the arrival of death.</p>

  <p>The first picture represents the god probably as feminine, with which
  the illustration on page 9c should be compared. The lock of hair before
  sign 3, the death hieroglyph, agrees with this as do also the familiar
  signs 2 and 4. The god is making sounds, which is indicated by the figure
  issuing from his mouth. Is the snail in his head-ornament to be
  understood as the sign for retarded motion?</p>

  <p>The second figure is the wounding serpent deity H, likewise
  represented here as feminine, with a lock of hair; the copal pouch hangs
  from her neck, her nose-peg resembles a flower as on page 19a. A bird is
  sitting on her head and is devouring a piece of an animal's body; we have
  already met this representation in the preceding Tonalamatl. Hieroglyph 6
  designates the deity H, 7 (Imix-Kan) probably denotes the devouring of
  the flesh and sign 8, which is an Ahau with a prefixed knife, may also
  refer to this.</p>

  <p>Finally, the third picture is again the death-god, who is clad in a
  gala cloak and, in contrast to the first picture, where the deity is
  sitting on some object, is squatting on the ground. The three hieroglyphs
  10, 11 and 12 fit here admirably.</p>

  <p>We will now turn back to page 4 and consider the lowest section (c) of
  pages 4 to 12, which like pages 5b-12b (I omit 4b here because its
  contents are of an entirely different nature) contain 7 Tonalamatls, that
  is, five ritual years of 364 days. If, however, we add 4b to these and
  bear in mind that 10c-11c contain a double Tonalamatl, we will have 9
  Tonalamatls. We find a group of 7 Tonalamatls also on pages 51a-52a.</p>

  <p>and there are four figures of gods.</p>

  <p>The sign of the rising Moan with its usual prefix and superfix
  (<i>d</i>) forms the principal part of this section, the meaning of
  which, however, is not yet very intelligible. This sign appears not
  merely as the 1st, 5th, 9th and 13th hieroglyphs, but all the four gods
  hold it in their hands. Placed after each of these signs are hieroglyphs
  2, 6, 10 and 14, which are the double Manik or hand sign denoting a
  sacrifice (<i>i</i>).</p>

  <p>The first god portrayed here is G, the sun-god, and the third
  hieroglyph is his sign, which is rendered yet more unmistakable here by
  the laterally elongated head <i>q</i>, the meaning of which is not yet
  wholly determined.</p>

  <p>The second god is D with his two signs in 7 and 8. 7 designates him
  rather as night and moon-god and 8 more as the old god and lord of the
  gods.</p>

  <p>The third god is the serpent deity H or Seler's "young god." His sign
  is hieroglyph 11, with which, to be sure, the unusual sign 12 (<i>v</i>)
  appears as a not very intelligible determinative.</p>

  <p>The fourth god is A and his usual signs are given in 15 and 16.</p>

  <p>The repetition of the 15th day at the end is superfluous.</p>

  <p>Here, then, we have the four days with which the 18 Uinals can begin;
  in the Tonalamatl on page 9b, the four regents of the year were given
  instead. Now, whether the beginning of these periods of 20 days was
  celebrated by a banquet or not, at all events, a feast is suggested by
  the sign Imix-Kan, which is <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>repeated in hieroglyphs 1, 5, 9 and 13. The
  four vessels in the hands of the four deities, two of whom are sitting
  and two standing, would agree with the idea of a feast. The first vessel
  is a cup filled apparently with foaming pulque, and the other three are
  larger vessels meant to be hung up. The first deity is D with a snail on
  his head. Compare page 12b. His hieroglyphs are 2 and 3, and sign
  <i>a</i> is added as fourth. The next deity is A with his usual signs in
  6, 7 and 8. C follows with his hieroglyph in 10 and lastly F with the
  sign 14 which belongs to him.</p>

  <p>There still remain as the 11th and 15th signs, the elongated head
  <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik superfix belonging to C and with another
  superfix belonging to F (with which he likewise appeared as sign 4 in the
  preceding Tonalamatl). The 12th sign (<i>v</i>), which occurs in exactly
  the same place in the preceding Tonalamatl, is no more intelligible to me
  here than there.</p>

  <p>Four sitting gods with the regular 16 hieroglyphs. There is no
  collective sign, however, among these. It seems exactly as if the
  intention had been to represent the <i>different</i> offerings usually
  presented to the various deities. At all events the sacrifices are
  designated by hieroglyphs 1, 5, 9 and 13, and the same objects are also
  held in the hands of the four gods respectively, although they are
  clearly recognizable only in the case of the second and third gods.</p>

  <p>Now what are these four different sacrificial gifts?</p>

  <p>The principal part of the first looks like the sign of the month Mol.
  In excellent agreement with its appearance is the fact, that this word
  signifies egg in the Quecchi language. The god receiving the sacrifice
  here is A. Hieroglyph 2 is his monogram and 3 is that of his companion F
  and 4 fits both deities.</p>

  <p>The second figure is D and his signs are hieroglyphs 6 and 7 to which
  8 is added quite superfluously. The sacrifice proper is denoted by 5,
  which, I think, is a sign of multiplicity and which was originally the
  fin of a fish. In the manuscripts and <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>inscriptions, when this
  sign is added to the sign for 360 days, it enhances the value to 20 × 360
  = 7200 days.</p>

  <p>The third picture represents the god with the bird-head of the Moan
  and his signs are hieroglyphs 10, 11 and 12. One of these, signifying
  rising birds, is also the offering in 9.</p>

  <p>Lastly, the fourth picture is, according to Schellhas, the serpent
  deity H, and, according to Seler, the "young god," with the snail on his
  head. His sign is hieroglyph 14. Added to this is the sign <i>a</i> in
  15, and in 16 it is <i>q</i> again with the same superfix as in sign 15
  of the preceding Tonalamatl. The sacrifice in 13 is represented by a Kan
  sign, which is equivalent to maize, maize bread or tortilla.</p>

  <p>Repeatedly, as on page 23b or 29b-31b of our manuscript, we see a
  portion of game (deer), a bird, a lizard and a fish represented as
  sacrifices. With this the fish and bird in our second and third pictures
  agree very well. I shall not venture to explain the other two in the
  first and fourth pictures. Perhaps future explanations of the curious
  head-ornament of the four gods will shed further light on the
  subject.</p>

  <p>The horizontal line should be read in this order; in the manuscript
  the numbers are in a somewhat unusual order.</p>

  <p>An attempt has been made to divide the 52 days into sections of 9 days
  each, and in doing this the sixth subdivision has fallen short of two
  days. Since this passage has but two pictures, six of the 12 hieroglyphs
  must belong to each of the figures. I read the hieroglyphs in the
  following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Each of the two pictures contains a building and a deity in front of
  it, each of whom seems to have placed another deity <!-- Page 81 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>in the building. In the
  first picture D is putting C inside and in the second F is doing the same
  to A or the Moan. I will add also, that the day belonging to C (Chuen) is
  actually 9 days distant from that of D (Ahau). I am uncertain in regard
  to the other two. In the back of each building we see a cross.</p>

  <p>A similar association of two gods appears again elsewhere, as on page
  35a, where D lies on a building in which C is sitting, thus showing an
  association of the same two gods as in our first group.</p>

  <p>In both groups the first two hieroglyphs form the common heading,
  since 1 corresponds in general to 7 and 2 to 8. In the first group 3 and
  4 are the hieroglyphs of D and 5 and 6 are the signs <i>q</i> and
  <i>v</i>; does one of these last signs refer to the god C? In the second
  group 9 is the sign of F, who stands in front of the house and 10 that of
  the god in the house, as perhaps is also 11, when we consider the closed
  eye; this is one of the many hieroglyphs having an uplifted arm as a
  prefix. On page 9a we find exactly the same sign. The last sign is the
  hieroglyph <i>q</i>, which sometimes seems to be used merely to fill
  space; it corresponds, but with a different superfix, to the fifth
  hieroglyph of the first group.</p>

  <p>The last three parts of this section of the manuscript all differ
  appreciably from the usual form (5 × 52 = 260 days).</p>

  <p><b>Page 9c.</b></p>

  <p>Here for the first time the manuscript contains a Tonalamatl, which is
  divided into 10 × 26 days. It is true the position of both the days and

  <p>Two figures and eight hieroglyphs are given here. I do not venture to
  decide whether each of the two figures with its hieroglyphs relates only
  to a period of 26 days or to the half of the whole, 130 days. I think the
  latter is more likely to be the case. The sign Imix-Kan, which I am
  inclined to refer to a sacrificial meal, is common to both groups and
  connects them. The two gods seem also to have a sign pertaining to a meal
  in their hands; this may be a cup.</p>

  <p>The first deity is D or I, but with a female breast and with a serpent
  on his head. His signs are 2 and 3. The second god is A with a snail on
  his head and his signs are 6 and 7.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, sign 4 of the first group is <i>v</i> and sign 8
  of the second group is <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>Here too Hieroglyphs 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 are the common factor;
  they have the form of the month Mol, but here, as on page 6c, they
  probably designate the particular object constituting the sacrifice. The
  following details are to be noted regarding the six divisions<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The god A with his two signs in 2 and 3. <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>2. D with the signs 6 and 7.</p>

  <p>3. F with the signs 10 and 11 (the latter <i>c</i>).</p>

  <p>4. E with the signs 14 and 15, having on his head a structure, which
  is compounded apparently of a Kan sign, a snail and the suggestion of the
  maize plant.</p>

  <p>5. G, clad in the gala cloak and the copal bag. His sign is 18, while
  19 suggests rather the Moan or K.</p>

  <p>6. B, his headdress displays the little circles, which often occur in
  connection with him, <i>e.g.</i>, pages 30c, 40a and 41a, and which may
  suggest the starry sky. His sign is 22; the hieroglyph <i>m</i> is added
  to it in 23 as a determinative.</p>

  <p>As usual, the fourth sign of each group is the most puzzling. 4 and 12
  are Imix with the uplifted arm as a prefix, as on page 13a, 8 is the
  hieroglyph <i>o</i>, 16 is <i>a</i>, 20 is <i>c</i> and the principal
  part of 24 is <i>r</i>. This sign <i>r</i> seems to me to suggest the
  week of 13 days (see above the explanation of page 4a); four weeks of
  this kind end here.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted further that all the six gods are holding one hand
  outstretched:&mdash;A downward, B upward and the four in the centre
  forward.</p>

  <p>This is another Tonalamatl divided into 4 × 65, the subdivisions being
  transferred to the end of the second, fourth and fifth weeks. The Chuen
  at the bottom is superfluous.</p>

  <p>The twelve hieroglyphs standing here according to rule are grouped
  together in fours by the three pairs of the first row. Of these 1, 5 and
  9 are the fist, familiar from the inscriptions, and which we also see on
  page 10b of this manuscript, where, to be sure, it occurs with the sign
  of B, as often happens, but here it has the closed eye of the death-god
  A. On the other hand, 2, 6 and 10 are the sign Kin = sun, with merely a
  dotted outline, and the three gods pictured below all hold the same Kin
  sign in their hands. This passage, may refer to the dying sun, the winter
  solstice. <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>{84}</span></p>

  <p>The first god is D, who, however, has B's head on top of his own. An
  object like a spyglass projects from the eye of B, which one could hardly
  venture to pronounce a nose-peg. The sign 4 (Ahau) refers to D; but what
  is the meaning of 3, the hieroglyph of the serpent deity H? Is the sun
  wounded?</p>

  <p>The second god is the baldheaded old deity, whom Schellhas designates
  as N. The hieroglyph 7, apparently referring to the five Uayeyab days, is
  his sign; we found it on page 4b and shall again find it on page 21c, and
  this time likewise with the old man. What is the meaning of the
  grain-goddess E denoted by sign 8? As N is connected with the close of
  the year, so E seems to be in various ways connected with the beginning
  of the new year.</p>

  <p>The third picture is unmistakably the sun-god G with the copal pouch
  hanging from his neck. His sign is 11, while sign 12, which suggests the
  wind-god K and balled-up clouds, is as difficult to explain here as it
  was on page 11c. The signs 8 and 12 seem, therefore, to refer to one
  another, and, if I do not see too much, look like a promise of rain and
  harvest.</p>

  <p>On page 12 the Tonalamatls of the three sections of the page come to
  an end and a new part of the manuscript begins.</p>

  <p><b>Page 13a.</b></p>

  <p>I shall here group together pages 13 and 14, the top third of 14
  encroaches a little upon page 15. 13a has the following Tonalamatl<span

  <p>I have supplied the first day, which is effaced. The week days are
  wanting. The 52 days are divided into halves of 26 days each.</p>

  <p>Of the 8 hieroglyphs the fifth seems to be the same as the destroyed
  first; aside from the prefix, it is the sign <i>s</i>.</p>

  <p>The two halves of the period have two gods, the first is B with a very
  singular head-ornament, and the second A, perhaps with the symbol of a
  snail on his head. Both hold a plant (agave) in their hands, as on pages
  10b and 12a. Hieroglyph 2, which is mostly destroyed, must have been B's
  monogram, 4 <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85"></a>{85}</span>has the Ahau as its determinative, and 3 is
  the elongated head <i>q</i> with Ben-Ik.</p>

  <p>In the second group 6 and 8 are the signs of A, and 7 is an Imix with
  the uplifted arm prefixed, as on page 10c.</p>

  <p>The month days 13 and 5 have changed places in the manuscript. The
  initial day VIII Ahau will prove to be of especial importance in the
  second part of the manuscript (compare page 70). Here, as in the
  preceding Tonalamatl, the period is divided into equal parts.</p>

  <p>Little can be said of the hieroglyphs, 16 in number, since 6, 9, 10,
  12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are wholly or mostly destroyed. 3, 7 and 11 seem
  here to be a comprehensive element, as is also probably 15, but I am
  unable to refer this head to a particular god; 2, 6, 10 and 14 may also
  be alike, but this is very uncertain. 1, 5, 9 and 13 may have denoted the
  four cardinal points, at least 1 suggests the south and 5 the north.</p>

  <p>Thus we have left for the four deities E, H, A and G, only the signs
  4, 8, 12 and 16; 4 surely belongs to E, and 8 to H, but the other two are
  erased.</p>

  <p>Of these the upper row again contains the comprehensive signs, and the
  lower the discriminating characters. The closed eye in 1, 5, 9, 13, 17
  and 21 suggests A, who also appears below as the first of the six gods,
  and the superfix of these signs suggests the south. 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and
  22 are the Kan sign, and we also <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>find this sign in the hand of each of the
  six gods. Thus the subject of this passage seems strictly speaking to be
  harvest or food.</p>

  <p>The six gods are A, E, C, L, F and D; the second, third fourth and
  fifth have a bird on their heads. The first and fourth birds are eating,
  as on pages 11a and 12b, and thus probably represent enemies of the
  harvest. The first is of a different species from the other two. The four
  gods in the centre have the copal pouch about their necks. Signs 3 and 4
  are the common hieroglyphs for A; 7 that for E, to which <i>o</i> is
  added as a determinative; 11 is C's hieroglyph with an <i>a</i> added to
  it, and L is undoubtedly denoted by sign 15; 16 is <i>r</i> (equal to 13
  days; it is meant here for the day III Cib). F appears quite according to
  rule in 19, which is appropriately followed by the sign <i>c</i> in 20.
  Finally the hieroglyphs for D in 23 and 24 are the usual ones.</p>

  <p>We come now to the large section extending to page 23, which, owing to
  the numerous pictures of women, forms a section quite by itself. It is
  not likely that this contains anything else than oracles relating to
  pregnancy; in fact, the period of 260 days represented here with great
  frequency is in excellent accord with this subject. In the Codex
  Tro-Cort. there is also a section devoted to women, which corresponds to
  this chapter and particularly page 19* of the Troano affords remarkable
  parallels to the Dresdensis, even in details.</p>

  <p>Apparently, the first two pictures have only 4 signs each, and the
  other two 6, but this is equalized by the fact, that hieroglyphs 1, 3, 5,
  and 7 are clearly each composed of two signs. The comprehensive sign
  appearing in 2, 6, 9 and 16, is, properly speaking, the sign <i>t</i>,
  which may denote coition, and, not unsuitably, contains in its centre two
  black figures side by side.</p>

  <p>Passing now to the separate four groups, I think the male figure is
  always on the right and the female on the left. In the first and second
  groups the two face each other, and in the other two groups the male is
  behind the female.</p>

  <p>1. The female figure is an animal, perhaps a deer, the male is a black
  and white spotted deity having a human form and his head appropriately
  embellished with horns. The hieroglyphs belonging to these are:&mdash;1,
  a combination of Manik and Chuen with a prefixed 4, just as on page 21b;
  3, likewise a compound sign, with a prefixed 7, which occurs also on page
  46c on the left, and which I do not venture to explain, but which seems
  to denote horns, and lastly the hieroglyph <i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>2. The female figure is an animal (on page 19a the female is
  represented more in resemblance to the human form) with a bird-head, to
  which belongs the compound sign <i>s</i>, still unexplained; the male
  figure is a barking (or howling?) dog, as on page 21b. Hieroglyph 7 is
  composite and contains first the sign generally belonging to the dog and
  suggesting a skeleton, which also represents the 14th month, and
  secondly, a Cimi closely related to it, precisely the same as in the
  parallel passage 21b. The well-known <i>q</i> follows in the 8th
  place.</p>

  <p>3. The god D holds in front of himself an animal, which may be a
  rabbit. His signs are hieroglyphs 11 and 12, while 13, the principal part
  of which is a grasping hand, clutching a Moan sign, seems to refer to the
  animal in the picture. 10 is <i>b</i> and 14 is <i>a</i>. <!-- Page 88
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

  <p>4. Lastly, two beings in human guise, showing thus a closer connection
  with what follows. They are the black god L with his hieroglyph in 18
  enlarged by an Imix, and a woman holding a Kan sign in her hand,
  hieroglyph 20 likewise showing the ordinary combination of Imix-Kan. Sign
  15, however, refers to the woman, and lastly 17 and 19 are the signs
  <i>m</i> and <i>r</i>; I note that <i>r</i> ends a period of 13 days.</p>

  <p>The contents of the following seem to suggest that we should first
  read page 15 (including the middle section of 16) from top to bottom,
  then pages 16-23, partly from left to right and partly from top to
  bottom, according to the subject.</p>

  <p>There are two pictures with 4 hieroglyphs each.</p>

  <p>The two pictures represent D and A, the latter probably as feminine.
  Both are falling headfirst, and both have leaves about them as if they
  were falling from a tree and a cry is issuing from A's mouth. The common
  element is given in hieroglyphs 2, 3 and 7, which are all signs of D.
  Further, 4 is the Chuen sign, the ape (as the animal living on trees?),
  its prefix is hieroglyph <i>r</i>, which I regard as denoting the week of
  13 days and which falls here exactly on the day XIII. And the same Chuen
  sign is repeated in the second group as the first part of sign 6, the
  second part of which is illegible. 8 is the sign of A and 1 is
  effaced.</p>

  <p>That is 4 × 65 = 260 days. Hence the sign of Ik repeated at the
  bottom, as is usual in such cases, is superfluous.</p>

  <p>The Tonalamatl contains 4 figures, of which 1 and 2 form one pair and
  3 and 4 another.</p>

  <p>As on page 15a, the pair at the left are falling down and also <!--
  Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>{89}</span>have
  leaves about them. They are god B, who holds a Kan sign in his hand, and
  a woman, whose eyes are closed and who holds the sign of death before her
  breast. B is falling down in a similar fashion in Cort. 17. Hieroglyphs
  1-8 belong to this pair. Of these, 1, 5 and 8 and also 7 refer to death,
  3 with the determinative sign, 4, added (which is the sign <i>q</i> with
  a Ben-Ik), refers to B, while signs 2 and 6 belonging to god D, who
  occurred in the preceding Tonalamatl, should be noted.</p>

  <p>The pair at the right on the other hand is <i>seated</i>, the woman
  apparently on the curved handle of a vessel. The head-ornament and
  hieroglyph of the female figure prove that she is the serpent deity H,
  while the male figure is the rare black deity M, whom we find again with
  his sign on page 43a for example; he holds a bone in his hand.
  Hieroglyphs 9 and 13 agree. The lower part of these hieroglyphs is the
  fist with the thumb unfolded, the sign at the top seeming to be merely an
  empty outline (Muluc?) and thus, like 1 and 5 of the preceding group,
  they seem to refer to a sacrifice offered to the death-god. 10 and 14 are
  again, strange to say, like 2 and 6 of the preceding group, the sign of
  D. 11 is the hieroglyph of H, who is represented below as feminine, and
  that 12 is a complement of 11 is proved by the upper part of this
  uncommon hieroglyph, which corresponds to the object in H's hand, and
  which is repeated on page 18a with the same figure; compare also page 8b.
  15 is surely the hieroglyph of M, who is pictured below, as in the Tro.
  2a and 22*a where the same M appears with the same hieroglyph, and to him
  belongs in 16 the sign <i>r</i>, which I am inclined to consider the week
  of 13 days, and which here, as on 14c, ends a section of 13 days.</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of ten parts, the days are to be read in the
  following order:&mdash;Lamat, Ix, Ahau, Cimi, etc. <!-- Page 90 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span></p>

  <p>There are two figures, A probably conceived as feminine and D with the
  same head-ornament as on page 10; both hold in their hands a Kin = sun.
  Hieroglyphs 2 and 6 are also the Kin sign, while 1 and 5 have the closed
  eye of A, but differ in their secondary parts, the sign suggesting the
  south being a suffix in 1 and a superfix in 5; 1, however, has an affix,
  while 5 has as a prefix a sign differing from the affix in 1. 3 and 4 are
  the signs of A, 7 that of D, next to which in 8 one would expect to see
  an Ahau, but instead of this there is again the sign of H (borrowed from
  page 15b?).</p>

  <p>This seems to end the subject of coition; now, in natural course,
  follows the subject of pregnancy, to which I believe the following
  Tonalamatl is exclusively devoted.</p>

  <p>There are no red numerals, hence the Tonalamatl seems to apply to any
  one of the initial week days.</p>

  <p>Two women are portrayed, both of whom are stretching a hand forward
  and upward. There are 8 hieroglyphs of which, however, the top row is
  almost entirely obliterated; 3 and 7 in the lower row are just alike,
  being the usual sign for woman.</p>

  <p>There is a decided contrast between the two figures, which might
  suggest barrenness and fruitfulness. Observation of their physical
  differences would give us that idea. Furthermore, the first carries on
  her back an unfamiliar head, perhaps A's, while the second has the Ahau,
  Imix and Kan signs, from which plants seem to be sprouting. The first is
  represented in the fourth hieroglyph by the sign <i>c</i>, which is
  closely allied to the death deities, while the second woman is denoted by
  hieroglyph 8 which is the sign of the deity E, the grain-god.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 16a&mdash;17a.</b></p>

  <p>In the following I will group together all the pages from page 16-23
  as follows:&mdash;First, I shall discuss the top thirds, then the middle
  and lastly the lower thirds. The sense, however, <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span>often seems to require
  that the first third should connect with the second, and the second with
  the third; but I find it impossible to determine exactly the intended
  order.</p>

  <p>On pages 16a-17a, we find for the first time in this manuscript not a
  Tonalamatl, but in its stead all the twenty days arranged in four
  columns, each of which ends with one of the regents of the year<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>This seems to establish the fact that the day of its birth was of
  importance to a new-born child.</p>

  <p>Between each column and the next there is a picture and above each
  picture four hieroglyphs, which, however, are mostly destroyed, so that
  much of the meaning of this passage is lost to us.</p>

  <p>The first is an old man walking, who beyond doubt is N, the Uayeyab
  god, with a staff in his hand and the signs Imix and Kan on his back. He
  is looking upward and is also pointing upward with his right hand. Of his
  hieroglyphs only enough of the fourth is visible to enable us to
  recognize in it the regular sign of N, 5 Zac. The second picture is again
  an old man walking with a stick, he is baldheaded and hence is probably
  also N, as on page 12c. His hieroglyph might be the fourth of those
  written above him, the other three are entirely unrecognizable. He has a
  carrying-frame on his back, but it is uncertain whether he is carrying
  anything upon it.</p>

  <p>The third figure is a woman who is pointing upward with one hand and
  with the other holding the bundle on her back, which I am unable to
  explain (does it refer to the 14th Uinal&mdash;the end of pregnancy?) and
  from which rises an object resembling a flame. Her sign is in the fourth
  place and <i>q</i> is in the third. 1 and 2 are not legible and perhaps
  may be supplemented by the third picture on page 19c. Finally, the fourth
  figure is F, <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span>who is sitting and has a Cimi sign on his
  back. His monogram is the second of the hieroglyphs above him, the third
  is very appropriately <i>b</i> and the other two are not very clear to
  me.</p>

  <p>The first two pictures might designate a male birth, the first
  indicating wealth and the second poverty, the third might denote a female
  birth and the fourth a still birth. But who can positively assert
  this!</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of five parts with 20 hieroglyphs, which
  unfortunately are so much injured that no signs comprehending the whole
  can be distinguished.</p>

  <p>There are five women in a sitting attitude.</p>

  <p>The first woman corresponds exactly to the third figure on page 15b.
  She is sitting on a bench, the same implement is in her hand and there is
  also a serpent on her head, for which reason she likewise reminds us of
  H. The third hieroglyph is hers, and the 4th sign is an Ahau.</p>

  <p>The second woman holds in her hand the Kin sign; above it is the Yax
  sign and above this a little cross between two dots (the numeral 18?).
  Compare pages 18c, 19c and 27b, and in the second part, 46b and 50c. I
  shall venture no opinion regarding the hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>The third woman with the copal pouch hanging from her neck has nothing
  in her hand. She is pointing upward with her right hand. Her hair seems
  to be wound in the shape of an 8 in horizontal position and above her is
  a sign denoting the union of two parts. The hieroglyphs are entirely
  destroyed. Does this represent the birth of twins?</p>

  <p>The eyes of the fourth woman are closed, she is pointing forward with
  her hand and there is a bird on her head. Nothing is left of the
  hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>Finally, the fifth is distinguished by a large nose-peg, which, as on
  12b, resembles a flower. Her hand is extended forward. The fourth of the
  hieroglyphs above her is her sign. There <!-- Page 93 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>is nothing to be said
  regarding the three others. Are these five women engaged here in
  presenting their thankofferings and prayers of thanksgiving for the birth
  which has taken place?</p>

  <p>Instead of Men the Manuscript has incorrectly Eb. Ahau in the fifth
  place is superfluous, since we have here a Tonalamatl divided into four
  equal parts.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs are so nearly obliterated that we can no longer
  distinguish a common sign. There were in all six signs for the first
  picture, of which the first two are above the day-signs, while the
  figures from the second to the fifth have only four signs each, as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>All that can be distinguished here is that the 4th and 13th have the
  same cross <i>b</i> and that 6 and 10 probably contain the same head.</p>

  <p>Each of the five pictures contains a woman sitting. In the first
  representation she sits opposite a male figure, who bends down to her
  with his bird-head, which we have already seen on page 13c. In the other
  four pictures the woman is holding the figure of a god on her lap. I do
  not recognize the god in the first picture on page 20. In the second and
  third pictures he is related to A or the Moan and the first figure on
  page 21 may represent the god D. These can only be new-born children
  represented by the gods under whose signs they were born. It should also
  be noted that the second woman on page 20 has a serpent on her head and
  the third a bird. The bird's head resembles that on page 16c.</p>

  <p>We have here a Tonalamatl consisting of 10 × 26 days, and the 26 days
  are subdivided into six parts. I have just assumed that the 2 is wrong
  and the initial VII is wanting over the first column, yet the 2 followed
  by the laterally elongated head <i>q</i> might here, perhaps, be
  explained in some manner as the sign of the day VII Oc.</p>

  <p>Apart from this sign which occupies an entirely exceptional position,
  we have here 24 hieroglyphs, <i>i.e.</i>, 4 for each of the six
  groups.</p>

  <p>The fourth sign in the first five groups is in each case a Chuen
  combined with the cross <i>b</i> and the suffix, which seems to be a
  knife, and also with a numeral, which, however, is not recognizable in
  the first group; in the second it is a 3, in the third a 7, in the fourth
  a 5 and in the fifth a 3. What can these numbers mean? 3 + 7 + 5 + 3 =
  18, and Chuen with the meaning of 20 (especially in the inscriptions)
  would be 18 × 20 = 360.</p>

  <p>In the fourth place of the sixth group there is a compound character,
  the main part of which (top, right) seems to be the sign for the
  thirteenth month, Mac, and which may also, as we shall see on page 24,
  denote the entire Tonalamatl. It is again compounded with a Chuen, an
  uplifted arm and a kind of suffix, and hence might denote the end of a
  Tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>The remaining 18 signs are in the main destroyed. In the second of the
  fourth group we recognize the lock of hair denoting a woman, in the third
  of the second group the superfix suggesting the south, which we find
  above the Cimi sign, for example on page 13b. Lastly, the other third
  signs are in the third group Imix-Kan, in the fourth group the head
  <i>q</i>, in the fifth the bird c and in the sixth a Manik sign with
  prefix and superfix resembling the sign <i>i</i>; in a few places (24,
  39a, 53a, 56b, 58b, 61a, 61c, 68c) the prefix might have the meaning of
  20. <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>Since the intention was to close this section on the next page, the
  space had to be used as economically as possible, and instead of the six
  pictures to be expected, there is only one and that is the first. It is a
  woman in whom I observe nothing characteristic except that she has a kind
  of cloak, which has fallen down over the lower part of her body, and who
  therefore remains unexplained.</p>

  <p>The Tonalamatl is no doubt to be read in this way after the correction
  of a few inaccuracies in the Manuscript.</p>

  <p>The 20 days, all of which occur again here as on pages 16a-17a, should
  be read from the right top to the left bottom, since they form but one
  series.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact Ezanab is distant 19 days from the future Caban,
  but 39 days distant from the desired weekday of the same name (see my
  "Erläuterungen," p. 24). Thus we have here a period of 20 × 39 days =
  780, <i>i.e.</i>, a three-fold Tonalamatl. The three Tonalamatls
  represented on the pages between the preceding passage (pages 16a-17a),
  where all the 20 days appear, and this, are of three <i>different</i>
  kinds (5 × 52, 4 × 65, and 10 × 26). This in itself is very remarkable.
  Furthermore a fourth kind of Tonalamatl seems to be introduced here,
  which embraces, as it were, these three Tonalamatls.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs, which are mostly destroyed, were arranged in groups
  of four for each subdivision, in the following order<span

  <p>Of the above the third hieroglyph of each group, <i>i.e.</i>, 7, 11,
  15, 19 (probably also 3) is always the same and is the sign of D, the
  moon and night-god. In detail we should expect to find five pictures
  here, but owing to lack of space only the first of these is given. It
  represents a deity with a Kan sign in its hand and a serpent on its head,
  who is probably E, and he is falling down here in exactly the same manner
  as the four deities on page 15 at the beginning of this section.</p>

  <p>Now, which were the other four deities? Signs 8, 12, 20 refer to A, H
  and C. 16 is the laterally elongated head <i>q</i>, to which Seler is
  inclined to refer the day Men, and Schellhas an undetermined deity I. On
  account of its frequency this sign must have besides a more general
  significance. In addition, however, we have in 14 and 18 the signs of F
  and B. 6 is uncertain, 10 is probably C, and the top row is entirely
  illegible. If to these deities is added the D repeated five times in the
  third row, it will be seen that all the important gods are grouped
  together here on the last page of this section.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 16b&mdash;17b.</b></p>

  <p>I will now attempt (for it cannot be more than an attempt) to separate
  into three parts, according to their contents, the middle and lowest
  thirds of pages 16 to 23. The first part, 16b to 18b and 16c to 20c,
  contains six Tonalamatls with pictures of women, each of whom carries on
  her back the figure or symbol of a deity. This deity can hardly be any
  other than the one to which the horoscope of the child especially
  refers.</p>

  <p>The first of these Tonalamatls, on pages 16b-17b, runs as follows<span

  <p>Of these 3, 7, 11 and 15 are the sign for women, 2, 6, 10 and 14 are
  likewise all the same sign, which is repeated in the same places on pages
  17c to 18c. I do not understand its meaning; it may have reference merely
  to the carrying-frame. Instead of the four women, whom we should expect
  to find here, only the first two are portrayed. The first carries B,
  whose sign is the first hieroglyph, while the fourth hieroglyph is the
  sign <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>The second woman carries A to whom hieroglyphs 5 and 8 refer. The
  third woman would have carried D, which is plainly proved by hieroglyphs
  9 and 12, and the fourth, F, as follows from sign 13 and probably also
  from 16 (<i>q</i>).</p>

  <p>Again, six women should be portrayed here, but there are only four;
  the second and third are wanting. The signs for the women are given in 3,
  7, 11, 15, 19 and 23, but in 15 and 19 the prefix is different from that
  of the rest. As from here on the women repeatedly carry a bird, the signs
  for this are 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 22, which are the symbol of a rising
  bird, as in the sign of the 15th Uinal (Moan), which in my opinion
  generally coincides with the 13th month of 28 days.</p>

  <p>The women pictured here have nothing in their hands, which they hold
  stretched forward, as is usually the case in this section. The first
  woman carries a vulture on her head. Compare 8a. In regard to it see also
  Schellhas, "Göttergestalten," p. 31. The hieroglyph of the vulture, which
  we find repeated on page 17c, 24, 37b, 46, 50, 65, is here hieroglyph 1,
  usually regarded as the sign of the bat deity, and near it in 4 is
  <i>q</i>. <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span></p>

  <p>The second woman would have carried the black deity L (hieroglyph 5),
  to which <i>q</i> is added in 8.</p>

  <p>The third would have had the dog, <i>i.e.</i>, the lightning dog,
  which we find in hieroglyph 9 and in the month sign Kankin; an <i>a</i>
  is added to them in 12.</p>

  <p>The fourth woman carries A, as is proved by his signs in 13 and
  16.</p>

  <p>The fifth carries nothing; according to the hieroglyphs 17 and 20 she
  ought to carry D.</p>

  <p>Lastly the sixth carries the Moan as is proved by signs 21 and 24.</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of 4 × 65 days. The Muluc at the bottom is,
  therefore, superfluous. I have been obliged to correct the 12 in the last
  column of the Manuscript by changing it into a 10. The red numerals are
  again wanting.</p>

  <p>This passage admirably continues the one in the preceding Tonalamatl
  containing the women carrying birds, and is also divided into six
  parts.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs stand thus<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Signs 3, 7, 11, 14, 19 and 23 (14 and 15 have changed places) denote
  women. Of the six women only the first three are here portrayed.</p>

  <p>The first carries the Moan with which signs 1, 2 and 4 agree
  perfectly. The second and third carry two birds, which may be parrots of
  a different species. They are very seldom represented elsewhere and hence
  their hieroglyphs, 5 and 9, with the added determinative 10 are
  unfamiliar. In 8 and 12 the well-known determinatives <i>a</i> and
  <i>c</i> are added. <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span></p>

  <p>Judging by sign 13 the fourth woman would have carried the same
  vulture, which we see in the middle section of this page; 15 and 16 are
  again signs <i>c</i> and <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>The fifth woman would have carried an unknown bird of prey, the signs
  of which are 17 and 18, and 18=10; 20 is again <i>q</i>, but with a
  superfix different from that in 16.</p>

  <p>Finally the sixth woman, like the third in 17b, seems to have carried
  the dog, as is proved by sign 21, but in 22 the symbol of a bird is again
  added. This passage ends in 24 with the well-known Imix-Kan.</p>

  <p>Here we again find the regular red numerals (Roman in my transcription
  of the text), which were wanting in the last three Tonalamatls. That they
  were not added until after the black script and drawings were completed,
  is evident in several passages of our Manuscript and also in this one,
  where they have been faintly indicated in black by the scribe (or
  corrector). The absence of red numbers in the passages 17b-18b and
  16c-17c is an evidence that I was right in proceeding directly from the
  former to the latter.</p>

  <p>Of the 12 hieroglyphs, 2, 6 and 10 have again the form which we found
  on pages 16b-17b, and which seems to refer to a carrying-frame; compare,
  however, the explanation of pages 25-28 below. The women themselves are
  designated by hieroglyphs 3, 8 and 12. The first woman carries the god A
  and hieroglyphs 1 and 4 are his regular signs. The second woman has on
  her back a Kin sign, above that a Yax, and this combination overtopped by
  a cross between two dots also forms hieroglyph 5; compare the upper
  section of the same page. That this hieroglyph is nothing else than a
  designation of god D follows from hieroglyph 7. Finally the fourth woman
  carries a figure, which has a Moan sign for a head and to which
  hieroglyphs 9 and 11 certainly refer. <!-- Page 100 --><span

  preceding Tonalamatl, and hieroglyph 5 is also a combination of these
  signs, but here in 7 we find, not the sign of D, but that of E, to which
  also the Imix-Kan in 8 corresponds. 6 is again the carrying-frame,
  though, as is also the case in 2, more indistinctly drawn than in the
  earlier Tonalamatls.</p>

  <p>At places 2, 7 (6 and 7 have changed places), 10, 14 and 18 we find
  again the sign which we think means a carrying-frame, while signs 3, 6,
  11, 15 and 19 are those of the five women.</p>

  <p>The first carries a figure with a Moan head and agreeing with this is
  the second death-god F in hieroglyph 1 and his determinative in 4.</p>

  <p>The second woman, who is seated, carries the same object regarding
  which I am still uncertain, which is carried by the standing woman on
  page 17a. This object is denoted by hieroglyph 5 (<i>w</i>). Its
  determinative is probably 8. It may <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>perhaps be a step in
  the right direction to point out that this sign suggests the god K.</p>

  <p>The third, like the first, has a figure with a Moan head, with which a
  female form of A in 12 and hieroglyph 9 accord.</p>

  <p>The fourth woman carries the maize deity E. 13 is his sign and the
  food hieroglyphs, Imix-Kan in 16, agree with it.</p>

  <p>The fifth woman seems to carry the somewhat indistinct form of D, if
  this may be inferred from the Ahau of the 17th sign. 20 is the universal
  sign <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>This ends the six Tonalamatls, which are represented in what I have
  called the section of the burden-bearing women. Five other Tonalamatls
  follow, which again suggest the idea of conception, which we met once
  before on pages 13c-14c.</p>

  <p>The most frequent sign in the five Tonalamatls, which I have grouped
  together, is the cross <i>b</i>, which plays the most important part in
  all the Tonalamatls, excepting the third, which differs from the rest
  also in other respects. It is essentially the sign for union, referring
  in the case of the stars to their conjunction and here to sexual
  union.</p>

  <p>In this Tonalamatl we see the cross in hieroglyphs 1 and 5, the sign
  for woman in 2 and 6, and their determinatives in 3 and 7.</p>

  <p>The first woman has a deity facing her who is devoid of all
  characteristic marks, and sign 4 is also nothing but the universal
  <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>The second woman whose eyes are closed, sits facing A, whose
  hieroglyph is in 8.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of this Tonalamatl is very similar to that of the

  <p>The first picture is wanting; hieroglyph 3 with <!-- Page 102 --><span

  prefix denotes a deity with whom I am not familiar. The same sign is
  found on page 50, left, middle; in 4 the usual head <i>q</i> is
  added.</p>

  <p>Beside the woman in the second group&mdash;not facing her&mdash;is the
  serpent deity H, again, as on pages 11c and 12b, with the nose-peg
  resembling a flower. His sign is 7 to which in 8 the familiar Ahau is
  again added.</p>

  <p>The subject now passes into the province of astronomy. This is already
  proved by sign 1, which represents the clouds, between which the sun or
  moon is usually pictured; the sun is probably omitted here merely owing
  to limited space. Sign 3 suggests the storm-god K (compare pages 7a and
  47 left) to which in 2 the Ahau might be appropriately added, inasmuch as
  it rules the year here under consideration as on pages 25b to 26c. On
  account of the Ben-Ik sign I see in 4 one of the months of 28 days as a
  more exact determination of time. Below the Ben-Ik a head is represented
  with eyes apparently closed, and this head is repeated in 6 and 10,
  though, probably for lack of space, without the Ben-Ik. In each of the
  three places a sign is used as an affix which might readily be the year
  sign, contracted laterally.</p>

  <p>The two similar hieroglyphs 5 and 9, which have the following form,
  are especially worthy of consideration<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:10%;">
      <a href="images/ill1.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill1.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The part on the right recalls by its trisection the sign <i>r</i>,
  which I regard as the week of 13 days and, in fact, the interval between
  the two hieroglyphs is 13 days. On the <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>left is the inverted
  figure of a person in a squatting attitude, the head surrounded by stars
  as on pages 57b and 58b and a sign on the back which may be a suggestion
  of the sun-glyph. In this figure, which occurs also in the Tro-Cort. and
  in the inscriptions, I see the planet Mercury and I believe that that
  planet's retrogression (which lasts 17-18 days) or disappearance into the
  light of the sun during this week, is the subject of this passage. 7 and
  8 are the sign for D with the usual Ahau, and 11 and 12 are the
  hieroglyphs of the death-god A.</p>

  <p>Instead of three pictures there is only one here, viz:&mdash;a woman
  with nose-peg, sitting on a mat and apparently waiting for something. We
  also find figures sitting on mats elsewhere, for example on pages 7b and
  68b.</p>

  <p>This is also a Tonalamatl of 10 parts (10 × 26). The first column
  should be read first from top to bottom and then the second. The days are

  <p>The signs forming the hieroglyphs into groups are, in addition to the
  cross in 2, 6, 10 and 14, the heads in 1, 5, 9 and 13 with an Akbal sign
  (indistinct in 9) which, by the lock of hair in 5, 9 and 13, refer to a
  woman. This lock of hair is replaced by a hand in 1.</p>

  <p>Sign 3, with which <i>m</i> in 4 is associated as a determinative,
  shows that the first group ought to have a picture of the black god L
  grouped with a female figure.</p>

  <p>The second group is the only one with a picture. On the right there is
  a female figure, which, judging by the headdress, <!-- Page 104 --><span

  page 19a. Opposite her sits the dog which we saw on page 13c. Here (in
  sign 7), as on page 13c, the hieroglyph of the dog is combined with a
  Cimi sign, and this hieroglyph is repeated in 8 with the sign <i>c</i>,
  which is so closely allied to Cimi.</p>

  <p>For the third group the god A should have been represented with the
  woman, as is proved by sign 11 so peculiarly combined with <i>r</i> as a
  superfix. To this hieroglyph <i>a</i> is added, doubtless referring to
  the good days, as if merely to fill space.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs of the fourth group do not, I think, convey a clear
  idea as to which deity belongs here. His sign is 15, which is compounded
  of Manik and Chuen with a superfix, nor does the Cimi added in 16 shed
  light on the subject. As for 15 we have already found it on page 13c with
  the prefixed 4, which I find prefixed in this way in at least 12
  different signs.</p>

  <p>Among these are hieroglyphs which are common to all the
  groups:&mdash;the cross in 1, 5 and 9 and the woman in 3, 7 and 15. In 13
  this cross is replaced by another sign, perhaps that for the year of 360
  days, and in 12 the sign for woman is replaced by the universal
  <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>Each of the three pictures contains a woman facing a deity. I will
  consider first the second picture in which H is the deity, as is proved
  by hieroglyph 6 to which an Imix is added in 8, with the uplifted arm
  prefixed as in 10c and 13a.</p>

  <p>Between the first and third pictures there is some <!-- Page 105
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>confusion. The
  first is D, for while his type inclines more to that of N, the other old
  god of the Maya Olympus, comparison with 23c clearly shows that D is
  intended here. But the year-sign on his head also suggests in some
  measure the Uayeyab god N and moreover this sign does not belong to D and
  only occurs again with him on page 23c. Further, there is no hieroglyph
  at all for D and instead we find in 2, 5 Zac, the regular sign of N. Also
  sign 4 fits N better than it does D. Furthermore this passage relates to
  the day Ik, which might very well be the last day of the year.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the third picture contains, unquestionably, the
  figure of N. I look for his sign in the 11th hieroglyph, which is the
  head of an old man with a prefixed 4, referring to the four different
  forms of N in the Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac years. The Ahau in 12,
  however, does not fit N, but D.</p>

  <p>This confusion can only be adjusted by transferring D from the first
  group to the third and also, perhaps, the sign of the woman in 3, which
  applies to all the three groups, and by transferring to the first group N
  and the 11th sign of the third group.</p>

  <p>The fourth group has no picture. It should have, as hieroglyph 14
  shows, the god F, who represents death by violence in human sacrifice and
  the chase. The hieroglyph Cimi in the 16th place is a suitable sign for
  this deity.</p>

  <p>This Tonalamatl, the fifth and last of this section, presents much
  that is irregular and puzzling.</p>

  <p>It can hardly be said that there are comprehensive hieroglyphs here,
  forming the heading of the six groups. The sign for woman occurs only in
  2, 8 and 24, and the cross <i>b</i> only in 14 and 18, but it is
  sufficient to make it clear that here, too, connection with a woman is
  the principal theme. Let us pass, therefore, directly to the single
  groups.</p>

  <p>The first group contains A and a woman. The god, however, is not
  facing the woman but sits beside her. The Cimi sign in 1, the familiar
  <i>c</i> in 3 and the unknown sign in 4 (=6) hardly explain this
  particular proceeding.</p>

  <p>The second group contains two persons who sit facing each other, but
  the representation is so obscure and peculiar that it is difficult to
  determine which is the male figure and which the female. The hair of the
  person sitting on the right stands up in a manner not found elsewhere. It
  forms a figure similar to that which is issuing from the mouth of the dog
  on pages 13c and 21b. The Cimi sign in 5 and the sign <i>c</i> in 7 are
  familiar, but the infrequent 6=4 remains a puzzle.</p>

  <p>Uncertainty regarding the third group is increased by the fact that
  there is no picture belonging to it. The well-known signs, 10 (Cimi) and
  12 (<i>q</i>) afford no explanation, nor does the head with the uplifted
  arm in 11, which we find with the same hieroglyph on pages 8a and 36a.
  The most puzzling is the 9th sign, which is composed of two crouching
  persons leaning back to back, and who also appear in the astronomical
  sections of the Manuscript on page 68a, not merely in the form of a
  hieroglyph, but also carried out in a picture. In my article on the Maya
  chronology published in the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie of the year 1891,
  I attempted to explain this Janus picture as meaning the change of the
  year, but that interpretation would make no sense here.</p>

  <p>The fourth group contains the woman opposite D, who is clad in the
  gala mantle and has on his head a bird and apparently the sign for a
  year, and is designated by the Ahau in 16, while Imix-Kan in 13, <i>b</i>
  in 14 and <i>a</i> in 15 are rather meaningless. <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>The fifth group represents the woman united with A, who is designated
  by the Cimi sign in 17. 18 with its <i>b</i> and 19 with its <i>q</i>
  display little that is characteristic, <i>r</i> in 20, which I think is
  the sign for the week of 13 days, invites further study. The sixth
  picture, which is the last, is very peculiar; it represents three women
  sitting side by side denoting perhaps the virgins who still remain. Sign
  21 as Imix-Kan, 23 as <i>a</i> and 24 as sign of femininity supply
  nothing in the way of explanation. As 6, 9 and 20 are the characteristic
  signs in the preceding groups, so here the characteristic sign is
  22&mdash;an open hand holding the day Ben&mdash;which perhaps designates
  these virgins by referring to the house in which they are held fast by
  the hand. Cf. Tro. 23* d.</p>

  <p>Now of the entire woman section closing with page 23 only the two
  Tonalamatls on pages 22b-23b remain. These Tonalamatls again display very
  many peculiarities and seem to be but loosely connected with the five
  Tonalamatls last discussed.</p>

  <p>This is a regular Tonalamatl, in which the 52 days are divided into

  <p>An Ahau is added here as the 17th sign, which is very unusual.</p>

  <p>We find elements here forming the hieroglyphs into groups in three
  different ways.</p>

  <p>1. The signs 1, 5, 9 and 13 designate the four cardinal points as they
  so often stand together in this Manuscript in the order of East, North,
  West and South, <i>i.e.</i>, in the sequence of the annual and not of the
  diurnal course of the sun.</p>

  <p>2. The hieroglyphs 2, 6, 10 and 14 are all alike and are the head with
  the Akbal eye, which in 6 is closed. <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span></p>

  <p>3. The three persons pictured here all carry a Kan sign in their
  hands, probably as the offering they have received. Similarly we found
  the Kan sign held in the hand twice on page 16b.</p>

  <p>The first picture is B; his sign is the third with the <i>q</i> in 4
  as a determinative, which has above it a Ben-Ik sign.</p>

  <p>The second figure is a goddess with a serpent as head-ornament, though
  we find in the 7th sign, not her hieroglyph, but merely the one generally
  used to denote a woman. 8 is the usual <i>a</i>, which in my opinion is
  the sign for the <i>good</i> days, to which also the Kan sign refers in
  the hands of the three personages.</p>

  <p>The third picture is that of the sun-god G; his hieroglyph is the
  11th, to which in 12 is added the sign <i>q</i>, the sign for the bad
  days, with a superfix.</p>

  <p>The fourth picture is wanting. According to the 15th hieroglyph it
  should be the maize deity E. My theory that 16 is the sign for the week
  of 13 days is supported by the fact that the division into 4 × 13 days is
  the prevailing one.</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of 4 × 65 days divided as evenly as possible into
  5 × 12 + 5. The 5th day added after the 16th must be a mistake (suggested
  by the 5th day of the last section) for it is usually the first of the
  days, which is repeated superfluously.</p>

  <p>Contrary to practice the first section has six hieroglyphs, and the
  other five but four each.</p>

  <p>As the characteristic hieroglyph we find in 1, 7, 11, 15, 19 and 23 a
  sign, the meaning of which is still undetermined and which we shall meet
  again on page 60, where it may refer to darkness.</p>

  <p>The groups have in common, furthermore, the head without an underjaw
  and the hair gathered up in a tuft in 4, 10, 14, 22 and 25 (in 18 perhaps
  represented by <i>q</i>, the evil days). We <!-- Page 109 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>{109}</span>shall find this sign on
  pages 25, 28, 30-35, 42-44 and 65-69, repeated a number of times in many
  instances. I consider it the sign for fast-days. It appears also in the
  Tro-Cort. Associated with this sign here as in other passages are the
  four sacrifices derived from the animal kingdom:&mdash;a haunch of
  venison, a bird, an iguana and a fish. The fish is beyond doubt denoted
  by 3, the mammal by 21 and the bird by 13, and I believe, therefore, that
  the iguana with its spiny back is denoted by 9. We find the four animals,
  though in a different order, also on pages 29b-30b, 30b-31b and 40c-41c,
  as well as in Cort. 3-6 and 8, for example. They seem to have a certain
  reference also to the four cardinal points.</p>

  <p>Only the first of the six groups has a picture (I?). This represents a
  woman with a serpent in her hair, holding in her hand a dish containing a
  fish. The woman is denoted by the fifth hieroglyph and the fish by the
  third. The 6th sign is an Ahau, which is not quite intelligible here.
  Sign 2=5 Zac is very remarkable; it is the hieroglyph of the Uayeyab days
  and of their god N. If this Ahau refers, as it often does, to the god D,
  it suggests the relation between D and N, which follows from page
  21c.</p>

  <p>According to the 8th sign, the second group might refer to the serpent
  deity H, and the 9th sign would not improperly denote the iguana.</p>

  <p>In the same way sign 12 in the third group probably denotes the
  storm-god K, with whom the bird in 13 accords very well.</p>

  <p>In the fourth group both the animal and the sign of fasting, belonging
  to it, are wanting, while 16 and 17 as well as the unlucky day in 18
  clearly refer to the death-deity A.</p>

  <p>The fifth passage belongs, as sign 20 shows, to the maize deity E and
  to this is added the haunch of venison in 21.</p>

  <p>In the sixth group we recognize Imix-Kan, the sign for food derived
  from the vegetable kingdom. It stands beside the grain-deity E of the
  fifth group. I do not understand the vulture-head in 26.</p>

  <p>The five deities specified here may be compared with those on page 24,
  which are denoted by hieroglyphs 21-25 of the second column, though the
  agreement is not perfect.</p>

  <p>This ends the first great section of the Manuscript, in which <!--
  Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>Tonalamatls are represented in
  uninterrupted succession. We come now to a page which stands quite alone,
  being the first which treats of astronomy and which ends the front of the
  first part of the Manuscript.</p>

  <p><b>Page 24.</b></p>

  <p>In my article "Zur Entzifferung IV" I discussed this remarkable page
  in detail and in what follows I shall conform to that treatise, though
  omitting many things which since then have become the established
  possession of science, and shall endeavor to shed a still clearer light
  upon other points.</p>

  <p>This page presents in brief the subject which is more fully treated of
  on the front of the second part of the Manuscript (pages 46-60).</p>

  <p>The first problem it presents is to find periods in which the solar
  year (365 days) is brought into accord with the apparent Venus year (584
  days). This takes place in a term of 2920 days = 8 × 365 = 5 × 584.
  Sequent to this is the still higher aim of bringing the Tonalamatl (260)
  into harmony with this period, which is accomplished in 37,960 days (=
  146 × 260 = 104 × 365 = 65 × 584).</p>

  <p>The revolution of the moon (28), the ritual year (364 = 28 × 13) and
  the apparent revolution of Mercury (115) come in question as secondary
  matters.</p>

  <p>I will now give an approximate reproduction of the page<span

  <p>And furthermore, at the right, bottom, I have substituted the third
  month for the second of the Manuscript, which proceeding will be
  justified later on.</p>

  <p>The least difficult portion of the contents of this page is the first
  series consisting of 16 members, each being a multiple of 2920. It begins
  with the date I Ahau (which is always concealed in these series),
  regularly stops at the month day Ahau (since 2920 = 146 × 20), but
  necessarily advances in the week days by 8 days each (since 2920 = 224 ×
  13 + 8), until 37,960 is reached, when the day I Ahau again appears
  (since 37,960 = 146 × 260).</p>

  <p>According to my method of filling in the numbers, the top row of the
  page consists only of multiples of 37,960.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the four numbers of the second row from the top are
  more difficult. They are, it is true, all divisible without remainder by
  260, but otherwise they seem to be without rule, and they give one
  somewhat the impression of a subsidiary computation such as one might jot
  down on a slip of paper in the course of some important mathematical
  work.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the following remarkable results are obtained when the
  first and third and the second and fourth numbers are combined by
  addition or subtraction<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1) 185,120 + 33,280 = 218,400, which is just 600 years of 13 × 28 =
  364 days, 280 Mars years of 780 days, 840 Tonalamatls of 260 days or 7800
  months of 28 days.</p>

  <p>2) 185,120 - 33,280 = 151,840, <i>i.e.</i>, precisely the highest
  number of the top row, = 416 solar years of 365 days each or 260 Venus
  years of 584 days each, <i>i.e.</i>, the product of the days of the
  Tonalamatl multiplied by the Venus years. We shall again find the 151,840
  on page 51, and Seler ("Quetzalcoatl and Kukulcan," p. 400) finds this
  same period on a relief of Chichen Itza. <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span></p>

  <p>3) 68,900 + 9100 = 78,000, <i>i.e.</i>, 100 Mars years or 300
  Tonalamatls. The half of this number, or 39,000, we shall find again on
  pages 69-73 by computation; also the whole 78,000.</p>

  <p>4) 68,900 - 9100 = 59,800, <i>i.e.</i>, 520 Mercury years of 115 days,
  or 230 Tonalamatls, or five times the period of 11,960 days, in which
  these two periods are united. By computation again we find the 59,800 on
  page 58. This period of 11,960 days is, however, to the period of 37,960
  in the proportion of 23:73, <i>i.e.</i>, 23 × 520:73 × 520. 23 is the
  fifth part of the apparent Mercury year, as 73 is of the solar year.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to the numbers, which form the bottom of my
  transcription, but only the left hand lower corner in the Manuscript.
  Here, in the latter, we find the following (with the correction already
  mentioned of the second to the third month)<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 2200</td>

<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 8 Cumhu</td>
<td class="ac pl2 pr2"> 18 Kayab</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 18 Zip.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The first thing to be done is to arrange and fill out these numbers to
  suit our purpose.</p>

  <p>The 2200 is clearly nothing more than the difference between the two
  high numbers. We can therefore dispense with it.</p>

  <p>Further, we find by the usual computation, that the second number
  belongs to the first date and the third to the second. Hence the number
  corresponding to the third date is wanting from lack of space. This
  number can be calculated from that date; it is 1,352,400. It would suit
  this date equally well if the number were higher or lower by 18,980 or a
  multiple of 18,980; but it will be seen directly that it agrees with the
  other two numbers only at the value given above.</p>

  <p>Now, if we add to this passage the years in which the dates must lie,
  they are in the case of the date on the left, the year 9 Ix, in the case
  of the middle date, the year 3 Kan, and of that on the right hand, the
  year 10 Kan.</p>

  <p>Then if we arrange the three numbers with the dates and years
  belonging to them, according to the value of the first, this part of the
  page will run as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 1,352,400</td>
<td class="ac pl2 pr2"> 1,364,360</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 1,366,560</td></tr>

<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 10 Kan</td>
<td class="ac pl2 pr2"> 3 Kan</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 9 Ix.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Let us now consider the properties of the three numbers
  individually.</p>

  <p>1) 1,352,400 = 28 × 48,300 and = 115 × 11,760, hence it is divisible
  by the month days of the year of 364 days and by the Mercury year. At all
  events this is the least important of the three numbers.</p>

  <p>2) 1,364,360. This looks as if it referred particularly to the moon
  and to Mercury; to the latter since it is equal to 115 × 11,864, and to
  the former if we assume that the lunar revolution has been fixed at
  29&#x2154; days, in which case this number is exactly equal to 46,000
  such lunations. If this last number be again divided by 115, the number
  of days required for a revolution of Mercury, the quotient is 400, which
  is a round number in the vigesimal system and which was therefore denoted
  by a single word, by Bák in the Maya (according to Stoll) and by Huna in
  the Cakchiquel (according to Seler). 1,364,360, therefore, is a Huna of
  lunar revolutions multiplied by the number of days in the Mercury period.
  Later on we shall find the lunar revolution fixed at 29&#x2154; days.</p>

  <p>3) 1,366,560. This is the most comprehensive number of the entire
  Manuscript, for it is divisible into each of the following
  periods:&mdash;Those of the Señores de la noche or Lords of the Cycle (9
  × 151,840; this is, however, the first number of the top row), the
  Tonalamatls (260 × 5256), the old official years (360 × 3796), the solar
  years (365 × 3744), the Venus years (584 × 2340), the Mars years (780 ×
  1752), the Venus-solar periods (2920 × 468), the solar year-Tonalamatls
  (18,980 × 72), the Venus, solar, Tonalamatl periods (37,960 × 36), and
  the periods which are generally designated Ahau-Katuns (113,880 ×
  12).</p>

  <p>We have next to consider the intervals which elapse between the three
  dates.</p>

  <p>1) From 1,352,400 to 1,364,360 is 11,960 days, which period we have
  already found once on this page by computation. <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>11,960, however, is
  equal to 104 × 115 and 46 × 260, <i>i.e.</i>, the Mercury revolution and
  the Tonalamatl combined. 11,960 is again equal to 32 × 365 + 280, and
  from the year 10 Kan to 3 Kan it is actually 32 years, and from the date
  18 Zip to 18 Kayab it is, in fact, 280 days. The day I Ahau must be
  common to both dates.</p>

  <p>2) From 1,364,360 to 1,366,560 is 2200 days, as the Manuscript
  expressly states. 2200, however, is equal to 8 × 260+120, and the
  distance from the day I Ahau to IV Ahau is in fact exactly 120 days.
  Further 2200=6 × 365+10; from the year 3 Kan to 9 Ix it is 6 years and
  from the date 18 Kayab to 8 Cumhu it is 10 days.</p>

  <p>3) From these two statements the third follows. The distance from
  1,352,400 to 1,366,560 is 14,160. This contains first the 14040, in which
  both the Tonalamatl and the old official year of 360 days meet, and
  second 120, which is again the interval between I Ahau and IV Ahau. But
  14,160 is also equal to 38 × 365 + 290, and the interval between 10 Kan
  and 9 Ix is of course 38 years, and from 18 Zip to 8 Cumhu it is 290
  days.</p>

  <p>The numbers with which we have had to do here will again occupy our
  attention further on, especially the 2920 and the 37,960 on pages 46-50,
  the 11,960 and 115 on pages 51-58, and the 14,040 on page 73.</p>

  <p>That these computations are not confined to the Dresden Manuscript is
  proved by the cross of Palenque, where we find in signs A B 16 precisely
  the date I Ahau 18 Zotz, a Tonalamatl before 18 Kayab, in D 1 C 2 exactly
  the difference 2200 and in D 3 C 4 the date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu. This is in
  favor of the theory that our Manuscript did not originate far from
  Palenque.</p>

  <p>Now, the question finally arises as to what may, strictly speaking, be
  considered the significance of these numbers, dates and differences.</p>

  <p>In the first place, I would recall the fact that the dates of the
  monuments of Copan and Quirigua, which doubtless refer to present time,
  are in the neighborhood of 1,400,000. The high numbers of our Manuscript,
  so far as they are in question here, form first a group, which extends
  from about 1,200,000 to 1,280,000, and then there is a blank, and next a
  large group extending <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span>from about 1,350,000 to 1,480,000, then
  another blank and lastly a group extending from about 1,520,000 to
  1,580,000. If we assume that our Manuscript belonged to about the same
  date as these inscriptions, then the three numbers discussed here would
  extend over a past period lying about 160-170 years back, when a new
  period of importance had begun probably dating from the immigration of
  the Aztecs into Mexico, which they placed in the first half of the 14th
  century (see "Weltall," Vol. 5. pp. 374-377). Now, however, the number
  1,366,560 contains the statement that 3744 years ago (each year having
  365 days) an event must have occurred, which can hardly be anything other
  (according to the belief of the Mayas) than the creation of mankind.
  Hence all the <i>historical</i> dates of the Mayas were computed from
  this starting-point. But how did this event come to have the date IV Ahau
  8 Cumhu?</p>

  <p>In my opinion this date is to be regarded only as the result of the
  far more important date I Ahau 18 Kayab, lying 2200 days earlier. Day 17,
  Ahau, belongs, without doubt, to the chief of the gods, and as the first
  week day it must have been especially sacred. The prophecies of the
  Tonalamatl preferably begin with the Ahau and with the I. The series on
  the page under discussion, constructed with the difference 2920 as a
  basis, begins with I Ahau, and the three series on pages 46-50 also have
  the same day as the zero point of departure. I Ahau is therefore the
  starting-point of the astronomical computations as IV Ahau is of the
  historical.</p>

  <p>Now, however, all the periods of 260 days end each time with I Ahau.
  Why is precisely this day chosen here, which is the 18th day of the month
  Kayab, therefore in the year 3 Kan, and lying 2200 days earlier than the
  historical date?</p>

  <p>Day 18 Kayab is our June 18th. In my treatise "Schildkröte und
  Schnecke in der Mayaliteratur" (1892), I have sought to prove that the
  tortoise served as symbol of the summer solstice, that the sign of Kayab
  was the head of a tortoise, and that probably the 18th of June was
  regarded as the longest day. The middle one of the three series on pages
  46-50 begins with exactly this date, I Ahau 18 Kayab. <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span></p>

  <p>But whence come the 2200 days? I will offer a suggestion which may
  serve until a better theory is propounded. Let us assume that each of the
  five principal planets had in succession regulated its time of revolution
  by this astronomical starting-point, thus:&mdash;sun 365, moon 356,
  Mercury 115, Venus 584, and Mars 780 days, these numbers added together
  give exactly 2200. It will scarcely excite surprise that I should set
  down the lunar year at 356 days (and not at the usual 354 days) for there
  are 12 × 29&#x2154; lunations in a year and we thought we had already
  found this period on this page, while discussing the number 1,364,360;
  also on pages 51-58, in addition to the half lunar year of 177 days, we
  shall find one of 178 days. Were the planets therefore created 2200 days
  before the appearance of mankind? Jupiter and Saturn, of course, with
  their 397 and 380 days are probably not considered here, because their
  periods of revolution so nearly correspond to that of the sun, and on
  pages 51-60 they are also treated as of secondary importance.</p>

  <p>I confess I am quite unable to discover what may have happened 11,960
  days before the creation of the stars&mdash;possibly the birth of one of
  the principal deities. Perhaps one of my fellow-students may succeed in
  finding an answer in one of the creation myths.</p>

  <p>We come now to the 40 hieroglyphs on the left half of the page. These
  are intended simply to familiarize the reader with those signs which are
  of importance in the calendrical-astronomical portions of the Manuscript.
  Since no phonetic system of writing existed, we cannot, of course, expect
  that the scribe should have explained these signs.</p>

  <p>Signs 1-4, which are mostly destroyed, can hardly denote anything
  other than the four quarters of the globe, at least we can still
  recognize in 4 the sign for the east, which has also the fourth place in
  pages 46-50. They stand thus together five times in the middle of the
  left side of pages 46-50, which pertain to this subject. 5 to 9 are the
  sign for Venus repeated 5 times, probably denoting the four parts of its
  revolution as on pages 46-50 and also the revolution as a whole. In
  connection with this first appearance of the Venus sign, I would mention
  that <!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>{117}</span>the same hieroglyph also occurs in the
  Tro-Cort., <i>e.g.</i>, Cort. 25c, though this Manuscript contains little
  else that is astronomical, yet it also has the rectangular heavenly
  shields.</p>

  <p>10. This is a well-known form of the Moan sign. In the Globus, Volume
  LXV, 1894, I sought to make it appear probable that the Moan also denoted
  the Pleiades, with whose disappearance and reappearance the beginning of
  the years seems to be connected. Likewise on page 50, where the
  2920-period ends, the Venus and Moan signs appear at the top on the
  right-hand side.</p>

  <p>11 and 12 are the same sign, being that of the 13th Uinal (Mac), with
  which 260 days of the year end, and hence this sign is also used as the
  sign of the Tonalamatl. The repetition seems to show, that not until the
  73 Tonalamatls of the period of 18,980 days are doubled&mdash;thus
  obtaining the number 37,960 of such importance here&mdash;are the sun and
  Venus periods brought into unison (with the whole system).</p>

  <p>13. The Kin sign (sun, day) with the superfix, which in all
  probability expresses conjunction, union, and which, in my opinion, we
  also see on page 51, combined with Kin and Imix, as the sign for 18,980
  days, is used here after the two Tonalamatls to denote the doubling of
  this period.</p>

  <p>14-18. If the preceding signs led us to the Venus-solar period and to
  the continuation of this subject on pages 46-50, these five hieroglyphs
  bring us to the Mercury-lunar period and later, on pages 51-58, which are
  devoted to the same period, we shall find a parallel especially on the
  last page. First comes 14, which, as has been acknowledged, is the sign
  for 20 × 360 = 7200 days. 15, a hand holding a rectangle divided by a
  cross into four parts, is, I believe, the sign for the period of 20 days
  augmented to 21 by the 1 in front of it. The much more distinct form of
  sign 16 on the middle of page 58 and also at the top of page 53, should
  be compared with the sign as given here. The top part is the familiar
  Ben-Ik sign denoting the 10th and 19th days, and the bottom is the sign
  of the 14th division of 20 days, which make up the year. Now, however,
  the 10th day, when it becomes the 19th of the next 20 days, is distant
  from the first 29 days. The prefix consists of two parts:&mdash;First two
  small circles <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>joined by a zigzag line, which I think
  denotes the division of a day into halves; the sign would then equal 29½
  days, <i>i.e.</i>, very nearly the true lunar month. Second, of two
  vertical lines, which might denote a doubling. The whole would then be
  equal to 2 × 29½ = 59. I admit that this interpretation is very
  artificial and I should be very glad if a better explanation could be
  found. On the other hand the 17th hieroglyph becomes quite clear when it
  is compared with the parallel passage on page 58; it is 13 × 360 = 4680
  days, a third of the remarkable period of 14,040 days.</p>

  <p>Thus we have</p>

  <p>which is exactly the lunar-Mercury period.</p>

  <p>The sign Xul = conclusion, end, is fittingly added in 18 to the end of
  this period, as also on page 58. This sign is very common on pages 61 and
  62 at the end of the long periods.</p>

  <p>From signs 19 and 20 we see that the four parts of the Venus year are
  also about to be treated of here, that is, the periods of 236, 90, 250
  and 8 days respectively, which are discussed on pages 46-50. For 19 is
  the sign for Venus, and 20 is a hand with a knife as a superfix, which
  divides the Venus revolution. This hand appears 20 times in like manner
  on the pages mentioned above.</p>

  <p>Signs 21-25 represent five gods, who in all probability are N, F, H,
  the bat-god and A. These are the same signs which are repeated twice on
  the left-hand side of pages 46-50, both times at the beginning and end of
  the period of 236 days, that is, the period during which Venus is the
  morning star and which is under the dominion of the east. The fact that
  there is a 4 with N has reference to the four forms which this Uayeyab
  god assumes. Now we ought to expect a similar treatment of the periods of
  the planet, which are under the rule of the south, west and north, but
  there is no room for this. Instead, we find in 26, 27 and 28 three
  different signs plainly belonging together, the <!-- Page 119 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>{119}</span>first of which is the
  day Caban, <i>i.e.</i>, the earth; the second may be Muluc denoting rain
  and water; the third is Chuen (the ape) which fittingly denotes the
  north, for Chuen denotes the little bear, as I have proved in my treatise
  on the day-signs of the Mayas. The Chuen sign in 28 also has a prefix,
  which probably refers to the night-god D. I find exactly the same
  combination in signs 8 A and 8 B of the inscription on the Cross of
  Palenque, but I must leave to others the task of connecting 26 and 27
  likewise with the north, which is very evident in 27 (Muluc).</p>

  <p>Sign 29 is entirely effaced. Nevertheless, I am positive that it
  represented the day IV Ahau, the beginning of Maya chronology, for 30 may
  still be identified as 8 Cumhu belonging to IV Ahau, and sign 31 is the
  same sign as 18, <i>i.e.</i>, the sign Xul = the end, and denoting here
  the end of the long period.</p>

  <p>The comprehensive hieroglyphs, 29-31, stand here in the wrong place. A
  more suitable position for them would be before 19 or just after 35. For
  they are intended to specify the periods during which Venus is in the
  west and south, <i>i.e.</i>, the time during which it is the evening star
  and the period of its inferior conjunction.</p>

  <p>Sign 32 is the black deity, L according to Schellhas, here denoting
  the west, and 33 is the Venus sign with the prefix denoting division. In
  the same way we find these two signs together on page 46 at the right in
  the middle series, where presumably the four Venus periods are specified
  in close succession. The black deity is also found on page 50 in the
  middle of the page in the beginning, at the end of a period of 250 days.
  On page 24 it has as a prefix the sign Imix with three rows of dots
  proceeding from it. Imix, however, among the Mayas and Aztecs (as
  Cipactli), under some circumstances often, and under others always,
  denotes the first of the 20 days. Hence this sign may mean:&mdash;here
  begins the Venus period of 250 days.</p>

  <p>34-35. The sign for the south still remains to be found. Sign 35 is
  again the Venus hieroglyph. In 34 we should expect to find one of the
  five gods of the south, which are found on pages 46-50, <i>e.g.</i>, the
  Moan, who is represented on page 47 as the regent of this cardinal point.
  But there is no figure of a god here, and in place of it we find set down
  here, as on page 47, middle, <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>right-hand, an actual date as the
  beginning of this short southern period of only eight days. It is the
  date 10 Zip (third month), the month sign of which does indeed suggest a
  hieroglyph of the Moan. Now, if we recall that in hieroglyph 21 the god N
  is designated in exactly the same way by an actual date, viz:&mdash;4 Zac
  (11th month), then we see that the interval between 4 Zac and 10 Zip of
  the second year following, is exactly 236 + 90 + 250 = 576 days, and this
  corresponds exactly to the interval of time from the beginning of the
  period when Venus is in the east to the beginning of the period when she
  is in the south. If we knew in what years the morning star made its first
  appearance on February 4th and disappeared as the evening star on the 3d
  of September, we should make some progress in the comprehension of this
  subject, but not much, since these events fall approximately on the same
  dates after each period of 8 years.</p>

  <p>36-40. The last five of the 40 signs appear in the same order again on
  pages 46-50, <i>one</i> sign on each page, in the middle group of the
  right-hand half of the page at the beginning of the third line, but with
  this difference, that on page 24 each sign has the same prefix, which is
  wanting on pages 46-50, where a similar hieroglyph always <i>follows</i>.
  From their position on pages 46-50 it follows that these are hieroglyphs
  of five gods, each of whom belongs to a whole Venus year of 584 days. I
  am not very sure in regard to these gods. I prefer to call 36 K, 37 F, 38
  E and 40 A. Sign 39 with the person crouching, I am obliged to leave
  entirely unsettled. We shall find this hieroglyph again, <i>e.g.</i>, on
  pages 47 and 49 right, middle. Let it suffice that in these five signs we
  have a repetition of the Venus-solar period of 2920 days, with which we
  will end the discussion of this page. Only F and A have already been met
  with among the five gods denoted by hieroglyphs 21-25.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 25&mdash;28.</b></p>

  <p>As these four pages, which are the beginning of the back of the first
  part of the Manuscript, not only belong together, but also display a
  parallel arrangement of their separate parts, the corresponding parts
  will be considered together as a whole. <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span></p>

  <p>There are seven of these parts on each page, viz:&mdash;the column of
  day-signs on the left hand; the top, middle and bottom pictures, and
  lastly the top, middle and bottom groups of hieroglyphs; but I will
  consider the pictures and hieroglyphs of the same section as belonging
  together.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">1. The Columns of Day-Signs.</span></p>

  <p>On the left-hand side of each page two days are repeated 13 times.
  They are as follows:&mdash;On page 25 Eb and Ben, on page 26 Caban and
  Ezanab, on page 27 Ik and Akbal, and on page 28 Manik and Lamat. Cyrus
  Thomas first made the important discovery that these pages represent the
  transition from one year into the next, but held the erroneous opinion
  that the last two days of each of the four kinds of years were treated of
  on each page. While Seler, on the other hand, found that we have here to
  do with the last day of one year and the first of the following year, and
  that, therefore, Ben, Ezanab, Akbal and Lamat are the beginnings of the
  years and thus of the 20-day periods. The years, however, were always
  named after their second day (<i>i.e.</i>, Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac
  years), since the New Year's Day was considered unlucky and it was the
  practice of the Mayas to conceal the real starting-point.</p>

  <p>These four pages, therefore, extend over 13 × 52 years, that is, over
  a period of 18,980 days, after which period all the calendar dates are
  repeated. A list of all these dates is given in "The Maya and Tzental
  Calendars" by William E. Gates (Cleveland, 1900).</p>

  <p>The transition from the Muluc to the Ix years is represented on page
  25; from the Ix to the Cauac years on page 26; from the Cauac to the Kan
  years on page 27, and from the Kan to the Muluc years on page 28. The Ix
  years are represented first, because the beginning of the historical
  chronology lies in an Ix year (IV Ahau; 8 Cumhu). This section treats of
  ceremonies, especially of the setting up of the idols at the changing of
  the year, which I can pass over here since they have already been
  described by Diego de Landa and in our own day by Cyrus Thomas in his
  "Study of the Manuscript Troano," and elsewhere. <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">2. The Top Pictures.</span></p>

  <p>The principal representation on all the four pages is a priest, but
  disguised as an animal with the head of a beast of prey as a mask (always
  the same one) and also with a tail. He is pictured with the same three
  articles in each of the four representations, viz:&mdash;First, in his
  right hand, the staff of office with the hand at the top, which,
  according to Seler, "Mittel-Amerik. Musikinstrum.," p. 112, is the
  rattle-stick, second the incense-pouch, <i>i.e.</i>, for copal, and third
  in his left hand a rattle, or, according to Schellhas, "Vergleichende
  Studien" (1880), a fan. There is one point, however, in which the first
  two pages differ from the other two; on the first two the priest is
  walking on dry land and on the second two through a stream of water. Was
  the city, to which this calendar especially refers, bordered in two
  directions by water, so that the road led across it?</p>

  <p>On all the four pages, however, the priest carries on his back a
  different deity, and I cannot find out by what rule these gods are
  connected with one another, or with the one which is represented below
  them, or with the years. On page 25 the god is B, on 26 he has the form
  of a jaguar (Ix), on 27 he is undoubtedly E, and on page 28 he is the god
  A, Cimi.</p>

  <p>Now to the left of the priest on each page there is one of the
  familiar Chuen bundles, such as are also frequently found in the the
  Tro-Cortesianus. Here, on pages 25-28, there are always three of these
  Chuen signs in a bunch. If Chuen really denotes the eighth day (which, of
  course, is only possible when Kan = 1), and at the same time the period
  of 8 days, then in this passage these three Chuen signs would properly
  designate the 24 days which elapse <i>before</i> the last day of the
  year, which is the last day of the 18th month. In the same way we shall
  find the Chuen bundle appropriately given this meaning on pages 42c-45c.
  Likewise the simple Chuen sign at the top of page 52 seems to denote 8
  days. But what do the Chuen bundles in the Tro-Cortesianus mean, some of
  which are much larger?</p>

  <p>In close proximity to these Chuen bundles we find numbers as
  follows:&mdash;on page 25 numbers 8 and 9, on 26 number 13, on 27 number
  2 and on 28 number 13. I can offer no opinion, <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>which would be even
  approximately acceptable in regard to the meaning of these numerals, but
  we shall discuss them later.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">3. The Top Hieroglyphs.</span></p>

  <p>I shall discuss these glyphs in this place, although each group seems
  to relate not merely to the top picture, but to the whole page. There are
  16 on each page, and arranged as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="ar">2</td><td class="pl2 ar"></td><td class="ar"> 9</td><td class="pr0 ar">10</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">3</td><td class="ar">4</td><td class="pl2 ar"></td><td class="ar">11</td><td class="pr0 ar">12</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="ar">6</td><td class="pl2 ar"></td><td class="ar">13</td><td class="pr0 ar">14</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">7</td><td class="ar">8</td><td class="pl2 ar"></td><td class="ar">15</td><td class="pr0 ar">16</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Unfortunately, the writing at the top is obliterated, which makes it
  impossible to understand not merely this passage, but also those on all
  the rest of these pages. Of the 16 signs in the top line only one is
  legible, and that is the first on page 28. This is the usual cross
  <i>b</i>; as a comprehensive heading it perhaps occupied places 1 and 9
  on each page, alternating with another sign in 2 and 10.</p>

  <p>In spite of this obliteration there are a few points which can be
  profitably discussed here.</p>

  <p>I would call attention first to signs 7 and 8 on page 25. The first
  seems to contain twice repeated the figure, which is thought to represent
  eagle feathers, and which we found on pages 10b and 13a, for example. As
  this double character is also used to change the 360-sign into a
  7200-sign, so it may also combine the 52 years of this passage. The 8th
  sign on page 25 is the head with the tuft of hair and no underjaw, which
  I think refers to fast-days, such as might properly occur at the
  transition point of one long period to another.</p>

  <p>The sign for the year stands five times on the other three pages,
  which is in keeping with their contents. On page 26 it appears three
  times. This page treats of the transition of the Ix to the Cauac years.
  In the 6th place the Ix sign seems actually to be used as a prefix, in 7
  the prefix is plainly the Kin-Cauac sign, just as on page 37a, and in 5
  the prefix is probably Ezanab, the beginning-day of the Cauac years. At
  this last place the suffix is the same as that which we often see with
  the year sign on pages 13c-14c. On page 27, in the 7th place, the year
  sign <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>has a prefix and a suffix, which seem to
  indicate that here it was intended to represent 365 as separated into 5 ×
  73 or 360 + 5. Lastly, on page 28 the 8th sign can be explained as
  meaning that the ritual year of 364 days is separated into 4 Bacab
  periods of 91 days each.</p>

  <p>Resembling the year sign in form, and placed near it on these pages,
  is the following sign<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:10%;">
      <a href="images/ill2.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill2.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>This sign frequently appears on pages 8b-9b, 16b-17b, 17c-20c. We find
  it with slight variations once on each of the four pages 25-28. It is the
  6th on page 25; the 8th on 26; the 6th on 27; the 6th on 28. Its lower
  part, especially the (phallic?) sign added at the left, suggests the
  hieroglyphs of the Bacabs, as we find them on pages 52, 55, 56, etc.;
  they might refer to the separation of the ritual year of 364 days into 4
  × 91 days. On the other hand it has been considered simply as the
  reproduction of the carrying-frame pictured below it (compare above under
  page 17c.)</p>

  <p>While the hieroglyphs, hitherto discussed, demonstrate the connection
  between the parts on the left of the four pages, two other signs prove
  the connection of the portions on the right.</p>

  <p>One of these looks like the Ik sign surrounded by a dotted circle; it
  occurs on page 25 as the 13th sign, on page 26 as the 15th, on page 27 as
  the 14th and on page 28 as the 15th. To this sign are prefixed
  successively the numbers 9, 7, 11 and 6.</p>

  <p>The second is unquestionably the hieroglyph for the numeral 20 or for
  the moon. It is effaced on page 25 and on pages 27 and 28 has a prefix,
  which on page 26 is used as a superfix. This sign is the 14th on page 25,
  the 16th on page 26, the 15th on page 27 and the 16th on page 28. The
  prefixed numbers are 7, 16, 5 and 6.</p>

  <p>The meaning of these two signs and that of the apparently irregular
  numbers is still a mystery. The latter will be discussed presently. <!--
  Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span></p>

  <p>The 4th sign on all the four pages seems to refer to a period like the
  one hitherto discussed. On page 26 the sign resembles that for the 13th
  Uinal (Mac) and hence appears to refer to the Tonalamatl, as in the first
  column on page 24. Above it is the sign for the south. The corresponding
  hieroglyphs of the other pages are obliterated, but strange to say the
  vestiges suggest that they too had <i>below</i> them the sign for the
  south. Now the south and the Bacab of the south preside over the fourth
  quarter of the year from which ensues the transition to the new year in
  question here.</p>

  <p>Among the signs on the left side we should expect to find those of the
  gods to whom the expiring year belonged. On page 25 it ought to be B.
  Sign 5, however, though it can with difficulty be identified, points
  rather to god K. Sign 3 on page 26 corresponds better; this is the
  hieroglyph of the tiger already known to us, which is carried by the
  priest in the upper section of page 8a; here its prefix is the sign for
  the west. On page 27 we ought to see the grain-god E carried by the
  priest; his hieroglyph may be destroyed, but sign 5, which is Kan-Imix
  (food and drink) is his determinative. Finally the 5th sign on page 28
  is, just as we should expect, the hieroglyph of A and, in addition, we
  find his determinative in 7.</p>

  <p>But what is to be said of the fact that the tiger appears again on
  page 28 in sign 3, and this time with the sign for the east?</p>

  <p>The Ahau on page 27, sign 16, refers to the god D of the middle
  section.</p>

  <p>There maybe some reference here to sacrifice, thus:&mdash;the 11th
  sign on page 25 is Kan-Imix, the 12th on page 27 is Kan, which is
  followed in the 13th sign on page 27 by another one with a Yax and a
  suggestion of a second Kan-Imix. Also the curious sign in the 8th place
  on page 27, which we have already discussed under page 8b, is used to
  denote the sacrifice on pages 18a and 15b. Here its position with
  reference to sign 6 is the same as on page 8b. On page 26 the prefix of
  sign 13, which is half destroyed, may be recognized as a serpent. Signs
  12 and 15 on page 25 are unintelligible. Unfortunately the following
  signs are entirely effaced:&mdash;Sign 1 on pages 25, 26 and 27, as well
  as 2 on all the four pages, 3 on page 25, 9 and 10 on all the four pages,
  11 on <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>pages 26, 27 and 28, 12 on pages 26 and
  28, 13 on page 28, 14 on pages 26 and 28, and 16 on page 27.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">4. The Middle Pictures.</span></p>

  <p>On each page at the right there is a house, the back wall of which is
  always marked with the cross often met with. In front of the house with
  his back turned towards it, sits a deity. Each of the four deities has
  the front of his body covered with a gala mantle. Now we know that the
  god of the new year was set up before the house of the chieftain. On page
  25 the god is K with his eyes apparently destroyed, and on page 26 it is
  B with a Kin sign on his head covering, hence designated here as a sun or
  day-god. On page 27 the god is D, and on page 28, A with the cross-bones
  on his robe, his own hieroglyph on his cheek, and the Akbal sign on his
  forehead. Only on the last page, therefore, and apparently by mistake,
  the god in the top picture is the same as in the middle picture.</p>

  <p>At the left of each page, <i>i.e.</i>, opposite the house and the god,
  is a flaming altar, bearing the sign Ix equivalent to fire.</p>

  <p>The centre, between the gods and the altars, is occupied by vessels of
  which there are two on each of the first three pages and but one on the
  fourth; they contain food, without doubt intended for the sacrificial
  feast. On page 25 the lower vessel contains Kan (maize) and the upper
  probably a food prepared from Kan. Or are the spines on the back of the
  iguana indicated on this vessel? (Compare 40c and Cort. 8 and 12c). The
  contents of the lower vessel on page 26 are still unknown (birds?). The
  upper vessel contains a Kan, but the sign has a superfix, which
  corresponds to the sign for the west. On page 27 the lower vessel
  contains a fish and the upper the sign for the south. Lastly, the single
  vessel on page 28 contains the cross-bones (mammal?) and above them the
  Kan sign repeated three times.</p>

  <p>Finally here on the last three pages, we find some numbers, which are
  still undetermined; on page 26 there is a 7 with the lower vessel, and on
  page 27 with the upper vessel two dots with a cross between them (perhaps
  this may mean 20 <span class="nw">-</span> 2 = 18, which is used in place
  of the usual clumsy numeral?). On page 28 we <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>see above the vessel a
  6, and below it, in place of a second vessel, a double Chuen sign, as in
  the upper section of the page, therefore it can hardly be the Akbal sign
  resembling Chuen.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">5. The Middle Hieroglyphs.</span></p>

  <p>On each page these signs consist of but <i>one</i> line containing 5,
  6, 3 and 3 glyphs respectively. The first of these signs in all of the
  four places is the same (<i>o</i>), which very suitably refers to the
  change in the year. The second sign is always the hieroglyph of the god
  represented in the middle section:&mdash;K on page 25, B as the sun-god
  on page 26, and D on page 27. The second sign on page 28, which is the
  head without an underjaw and with the prefixed four, probably referring
  to four fast-days, must, therefore, be an uncommon sign for A, who was
  similarly designated on page 25 in sign 8 of the upper section.</p>

  <p>If the gods in the top thirds are those of the past year and those in
  the middle the gods of the year just beginning, we should expect to find
  in each top third the deity who is represented in the middle of the
  preceding page. But this does not hold good. For then we should expect to
  find K on page 26 and not the tiger, on page 27 B or G and not E, on page
  28 D and not A, and on page 25 A and not B.</p>

  <p>Hence there is some confusion here. Yet it seems to be in the nature
  of a correction, that on page 26 the third sign, next to that of the
  sun-god, is actually the sign for E who is in the top section on page 27,
  and that the sixth sign is Kan-Imix belonging to this god.</p>

  <p>On pages 25 and 26 this line also refers to the past year,
  <i>i.e.</i>, to the year set down in the top third. The fourth sign on
  page 25 is a Manik, <i>i.e.</i>, originally a grasping hand denoting
  taking away, disappearance, and the fifth sign on this page is a Muluc,
  which seems to denote the ending of the Muluc years. The fifth sign on
  page 26, is, in fact, the tiger pictured above.</p>

  <p>The lunar hieroglyph as the third sign on page 25 and the <i>a</i> as
  the fourth on page 26 are strange and unaccountable. Both appear to be
  almost without significance here and seem almost like mere points between
  the names of gods in groups of two each. <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <p>The Ahau as the third sign on page 27 is the usual determinative of D,
  whose hieroglyph stands beside it.</p>

  <p>On page 28 the main part of the third sign corresponds to the sixth of
  the upper section. I do not know, however, how to explain either the
  upper part suggesting a mat or the familiar leaf-shaped prefix.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">6. The Bottom Pictures.</span></p>

  <p>In the left-hand lower corner of each page we see the sign for the
  year of 360 days, which at the same time designates the heap of stones,
  on which the stelae were erected, the two thick black lines indicating
  the two columns of hieroglyphs usually found on them. A tree is growing
  out of this sign, having on its trunk an abbreviated Cauac sign, at
  least, on pages 26, 27 and 28, which probably refers to rain as the most
  desired event of the year. The tree on page 25 has no leaves, but the top
  is carved into the shape of the head of the god B. In the other three
  cases it has leaves, but instead of ending in the god's head the tree is
  draped with a mantle and a breech-clout, and a serpent is coiled about it
  denoting a period of time (here, the year). Furthermore there are
  foot-prints on the trunk or the drapery of the tree, which represent it
  as the goal of a pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>If the top and middle thirds refer to the mere transportation of the
  idols, the bottom thirds refer to the feasts connected with this act, or,
  at any rate, to those dedicated to the <i>new</i> god. For we see here on
  page 25 the god B, on 26 the god K, on 27 A and on 28 D, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  same deities as in the middle sections, yet so placed that the first two
  and the last two have changed places.</p>

  <p>Each of the four deities hold in one hand a hen with its head cut off;
  "degollavan una gallina" is the statement made by Landa concerning these
  feasts. Perhaps all four gods, at any rate the last three, are scattering
  grain; this was one form of divination; we found the other on page 2.
  There are besides, on every page, several small objects between the two
  pictures, just as in the middle section. On page 25 the object is
  probably an altar, but instead of the flame it has the number 19. Above
  this is the sign for the west (the Ix days) with that for the sun, and on
  top of them the sign <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>which we found in the middle section of
  page 26 as the contents of the lower vessel. On page 26 we see a vessel
  containing a bird, then another whose contents are indicated by Yax and a
  double Kan sign. Above it is the sign for the moon or for 20 with a
  prefix, and above this a 9. At the bottom of page 27 there is a vessel
  containing two Kan signs and a fish; above this another vessel the
  contents of which are the same as we found in the vessel in the middle
  section of page 26 and in that of the lower section of page 25. Above
  these is again the sign for the moon or 20 with a superfix, which is the
  same as the prefix on page 26, and beside it is a 16. Page 28 has the
  usual haunch of venison (Landa:&mdash;"una pierna de venado"), above this
  is a vessel with a bird and Kan and above this again the sign for the
  moon or for 20 with the same superfix and the numeral 15. I shall discuss
  below the numbers scattered over these four pages.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">7. The Bottom Hieroglyphs.</span></p>

  <p>These hieroglyphs also form but <i>one</i> line on each page and each
  line contains six hieroglyphs. The <i>first</i> of each line is always
  the same (<i>p</i>). It consists of a surface divided into four quadrants
  thus suggesting the four cardinal points, the four Bacabs presiding over
  them and the four kinds of years. The superfix seems to be the
  abbreviated hieroglyph of the north; the sign for the north, however, is
  Muluc and these four pages begin with the Muluc years.</p>

  <p>The <i>second</i> sign is the head of D as the supreme god; to this a
  Yax is joined on pages 26-28 as the symbol of strength, and on page 25,
  but probably by mistake, the abbreviated sign for the west.</p>

  <p>The <i>third</i> sign always represents one of the four cardinal
  points:&mdash;on page 25 the east, on page 26 the south, on page 27 the
  west and on page 28 the north; here then the usual order is reversed and
  the signs are set down according to the diurnal instead of the annual
  course of the sun, probably occasioned merely by exchanging the sign for
  the west (Ix), which belongs on page 25, with that for the east (Kan),
  which belongs on page 27. <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span></p>

  <p>The other three signs do not stand in the same order on every
  page.</p>

  <p>The <i>fifth</i> sign on pages 26 and 28 and the <i>fourth</i> on page
  27 show correspondence most clearly. This sign is always a head,
  undoubtedly that of the god pictured in the bottom third. But on page 25
  it is the hieroglyph of E, who is pictured on the top of page 27, instead
  of that of B.</p>

  <p>In the same way the 6th sign on page 25, the 4th on page 26, the 5th
  on page 27 and the 4th on page 28 have something in common. One element
  of the hieroglyph is always the sign for the year of 360 days, combined
  on page 25 with cross-bones and the Cauac sign, on 26 with Yax and Kan,
  and on 27 and 28 simply with Yax.</p>

  <p>The most puzzling and divergent of these hieroglyphs are the remaining
  ones. The 4th on page 25 has an oblique cross (or bones?) and the
  abbreviated glyph for the west, the 6th on page 26 is the head of E, the
  6th on page 27 is the 360-day sign combined with Kin and Cauac, and the
  6th on page 28 is the usual Kan-Imix sign. Here, too, there seems to have
  been a displacement.</p>

  <p>Before I leave the four pages 25-28, I will glance at the numerals,
  which are scattered over them and which apparently have no connection
  with one another. I have discussed these numerals in my article "Die
  Mayahieroglyphen" in Volume LXXI, No. 5, of the Globus, and the following
  is borrowed therefrom.</p>

  <p>First of all, I believe that I proved there, that the sign composed of
  two dots with a cross between them is an abbreviation for the usual
  clumsy representation of the numeral 18 and designates it like a
  duodeviginti by 20 <span class="nw">-</span> 2. Next, that in this
  passage as on pages 18a, 18c, 19c, 46b and 50c, the sign is combined with
  the hieroglyphs Yax-Kin. Third, that it is closely related to the god D,
  inasmuch as it stands on page 27b close beside the picture of that
  god.</p>

  <p>Assuming this as a known fact, we find scattered over these four pages
  the following numbers<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 131

  <p>It is very remarkable that the sum of the numbers on each of the first
  three pages is equal to 52, and as an accidental freak it would be most
  surprising; somewhere on the fourth page six units may have been omitted;
  but perhaps the 6, which stands above the <i>two</i> Chuen signs in the
  centre, is to be counted twice. The 52, however, designates the very 52
  years, which are treated of on these four pages.</p>

  <p>As yet I know no reason to account for the fact that the 52 is here
  separated into these apparently very irregular numbers. The discovery of
  this reason would be an important step in advance. Or does it means 52
  <i>days</i>, perhaps those which follow a Tonalamatl coming in the middle
  of the year?</p>

  <p>Page 28 is followed in the Manuscript by three empty pages. The
  scribe's object in reserving them is beyond our ken; possibly they were
  intended to represent the period of 8 years.</p>

  <p>Pages 29-45 (<i>i.e.</i>, to the end of the first part of the
  Manuscript) all belong together. After the Maya manner there is very
  little system displayed in their arrangement, and though here and there
  there may be occasion to consider the three parts of each page
  consecutively, I will discuss them here as follows:&mdash;First, the top
  thirds, which are most difficult owing to the destruction of a large
  portion of them; then the middle, and last the bottom thirds. They all
  consist in great part, with a few interruptions, of representations of
  the regular Tonalamatl, such as we find represented from the beginning of
  the Manuscript to page 23.</p>

  <p>The element which these pages have in common is the fact that the god
  B, who can hardly be Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl, occurs on almost all of
  them. He is the god of wind, fire, breath, <i>i.e.</i>, the true god of
  life and is here represented in his relation to the most varied
  manifestations and activities of a human being, so that this section
  bears a certain resemblance to the Tro-Cortesianus. With this is closely
  connected his relation to all <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>four cardinal points, which so often
  occur. He may have been the local god of the region from whence this
  Manuscript came; in the Tro-Cort. It seems rather to be C who lays claim
  to this office.</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of 4 × 65 days, each part subdivided into 5 × 13
  days. The four days written on the left are those which may begin the
  year.</p>

  <p>In each of the five sections B is pictured in a sitting posture, the
  first four times on a tree (the tree of life rather than the sacrificial
  tree).</p>

  <p>In the first picture he holds in one hand the haunch of venison, so
  often occurring as an offering, the last time on page 28; the object
  above it is probably the Kan sign. There is a vessel at the god's feet,
  probably a receptacle for the venison, bearing the hieroglyph of the 13th
  day Cib, which, however, refers rather to a bird.</p>

  <p>In the second picture an animal with a protruding tongue lies on its
  back at the feet of the god, who kneels upon its stomach. This probably
  represents the lightning-dog as vanquished. The same animal is pictured
  on the next page and also on page 40b and perhaps on page 60. There are a
  number of small dots around B's head, which on page 11c we attempted to
  interpret as the starry sky.</p>

  <p>I can find nothing of special importance in the third and fourth
  pictures, but in the fifth, B is sitting in a house, which is marked
  repeatedly with the sign Caban (ground). Here the god is holding the
  hatchet (machete) in his hand, as if prepared for some terrestrial
  activity. Four hieroglyphs in the usual order belong to each of the five
  pictures. They are almost entirely destroyed, but the vestiges show that
  the fourth sign was always that of B, while the third sign with the first
  picture had the abbreviated hieroglyph of the west as a prefix; with the
  second picture it had that of the south, and therefore with the third and
  fourth it must certainly have had the signs of the east and north. We
  should expect the signs with these <!-- Page 133 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>prefixes to contain
  references to Ix, Cauac, Kan and Muluc, but they are not
  distinguishable.</p>

  <p>Thus B is represented in pictures 1-4 as ruler of the four cardinal
  points and in 5 as the ruler of the earth in general.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 30a&mdash;31a.</b></p>

  <p>This passage looks like an amplification of the middle picture on page
  29a. Here B is represented with the hatchet in his left hand and holding
  aloft by the tail with his right hand the animal, which is spitting out
  something upon a stepped pyramidal structure, probably the pyramid of a
  teocalli. That this is probably meant to represent lightning is rendered
  almost a certainty by the picture on page 40b. In this passage there are
  several red and black numerals scattered around the animal in an
  irregular manner, which we find nowhere else in our Manuscript, but with
  which the Tro-Cortesianus has made us familiar. The sum of the black
  numbers still legible is 23, probably a 3 is effaced and the sum should
  be 26, the sum which so often occurs in the Cod. Troano 8-13 with the
  animal represented there. The red numbers likewise do not admit of exact
  determination. This passage also contained hieroglyphs, four standing
  side by side on each of the two pages. The legible portion is limited to
  the Cimi sign in the third place, perhaps an Imix in the second, and
  possibly an Ahau in the first.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 31a&mdash;32a.</b></p>

  <p>In my article "Zur Entzifferung, etc., VI," published in the year
  1897, I discussed this passage more in detail, and the following will be
  in continuation of what I stated there.</p>

  <p>The real aim of the computation on these pages is to find a number in
  which the following periods of time are united with the Tonalamatl of 260
  days:&mdash;1. The ritual year of 364 days, and consequently also a
  quarter of it, the Bacab period of 91 days. 2. The period of 104 days,
  being the number of days which remain after a Tonalamatl has been
  deducted from a ritual year. The hypothesis advanced by Mrs. Zelia
  Nuttall ("Note on the Ancient Mexican Calendar System," Stockholm, 1894)
  and also the entirely different opinion held by Mr. Charles P. Bowditch
  ("The Lords of the Night and the Tonalamatl of the Codex <!-- Page 134
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>Borbonicus" in
  the American Anthropologist, N. S., Vol. II, New York, 1900) prove the
  existence not only of merely arbitrary Tonalamatls for the purpose of
  prediction, as those in our Manuscript, but also of Tonalamatls having a
  fixed position in certain years. But after the manner peculiar to
  priestcraft, the number sought is found only by an indirect and
  mysterious process.</p>

  <p>In the first place we find on page 32a all the days set down in the
  following manner<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

  <p>That is to say, a series counting from the day XIII Akbal, the New
  Year's day of the year I Kan, recurring every 52 years, furthermore a
  series which shows the same difference of 91 from the day XIII Akbal to
  XIII Ix, XIII Chicchan, etc., and finally ends with XIII Akbal again,
  after it has run through a period of 20 × 91, <i>i.e.</i>, 1820 days = 7
  Tonalamatls, like a similar representation of 7 Tonalamatls on page 51.
  Above these 20 days, and to the left of them, numbers are set down rather
  irregularly, which begin with 91 and are multiples of that number. The
  signs of the days corresponding to these numbers are joined to them; but
  they are omitted with the numbers of lowest value. Hence we
  have:&mdash;91, 182, 273, 364 (4), 455 (5), 546 (6), 637 (7), 728 (8),
  819 (9), 910 (10). Then with a bound follow 1456 and 1820; with the last
  number Akbal is reached in the natural way, which day the scribe had
  erroneously set down again with 1456 in place of Cauac.</p>

  <p>The number 728 already united the numbers 91, 104 and 364, but did not
  include the number 260. This inclusion is accomplished by the number 3640
  on page 32, quite on the left where we find the numbers 10 and 2, under
  which only a 0 has been omitted. With the usual hiatuses this series
  seems to end on page 31, where I think the numbers 4, 0, 16 and 0 ought
  to stand, but they are almost wholly effaced; this would then be 320 ×
  91, 280 × 104, 112 × 260, 80 × 364 = 29,120. <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span></p>

  <p>We have thus gone far in advance of the first problem, but a second
  always presents itself in these series, it is that of using these periods
  for larger numbers, which refer to a not too remote past or to a future
  not too distant. The first numbers are, as a rule, in the neighborhood of
  1,252,680, the close of the eleventh Ahau-Katun, and the latter in the
  neighborhood of 1,480,440, the close of the thirteenth Ahau-Katun. The
  Manuscript presents the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In connection with this it should be noted first that I have restored
  the 8 in the statement of the months, and second that the two numbers on
  the right were found with the aid of page 63 only by an easy conjecture.
  For with the reading of the Manuscript 10, 13, 3, 13, 2, I do not agree,
  but read instead 10, 13, 13, 3, 2; the number below, however, is given in
  the Manuscript as 7, 2 and then a black 14 joined to a red 5; I read this
  7, 2, 14, 19.</p>

  <p>The three numbers nearest the bottom have red circles around them,
  indicating subtraction, or, according to my present point of view,
  addition.</p>

  <p>Now let us see how the computer arrived at the large numbers.</p>

  <p>Day XIII Akbal, the New Year's day of the 1 Kan years, is given; also
  the differences of the series 91 and 104, therefore also in the
  proportion of 7 to 8. If we combine these last two numbers by addition
  and then by multiplication with 260, the result is (7 + 8) × 260 = 3900.
  If, however, 7, 8 and 3900 be combined by multiplication the product is 7
  × 8 × 3900 = 218,400 = 2400 × 91 = 2100 × 104 = 840 × 260 = 600 × 364 =
  1120 × (91 + 104). We have already met with the 218,400 on page 24, which
  was obtained by the addition of 33,280 + 185,120.</p>

  <p>My opinion is as follows:&mdash;First 11 Ahau-Katuns = 1,252,680, were
  taken as a point of departure, and to this sum was <!-- Page 136 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>{136}</span>added 15,600 = 4 ×
  3900, and 243 as the interval between the normal date IV Ahau and XIII
  Akbal. The result was 1,268,523. The position of this day, however, is
  XIII Akbal 11 Xul (1 Ix).</p>

  <p>Then the 3900 mentioned above was added to this number and the result
  was 1,272,423 = XIII Akbal 16 Pop (12 Muluc).</p>

  <p>Then to the 1,268,523 was added the 218,400 and the sum was 1,486,923
  = XIII Akbal 1 Kankin (1 Kan), the very place in that year where a
  Tonalamatl ends.</p>

  <p>The following numbers were thus obtained<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 1,272,423</td>
<td class="ac pl2 pr2"> 1,268,523</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 1,486,923.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>These numbers are suppressed in the Manuscript. But if the encircled
  numbers are added to them, viz:&mdash;121 (interval between XIII Akbal
  and IV Kan), 17 (interval between XIII Akbal and IV Ahau), and 51,419 (=
  197 × 260 + 199; 199, however, is the interval between XIII Akbal and IV
  Ik), the result is the three large numbers set down in the Manuscript,
  which have the following properties<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1) 1,272,544 = IV Kan 17 Xul (12 Muluc). This number = 13,984 × 91 =
  12,236 × 104 = 3496 × 364. It also = 4894 × 260 + 104, the interval
  between IV Ahau and IV Kan.</p>

  <p>2) 1,268,540 = IV Ahau 8 Mol (1 Ix) = 4879 × 260 = 3485 × 364 = 74,620
  × 17. 17 is the interval between XIII Akbal and IV Ahau.</p>

  <p>3) 1,538,342 = IV Ik 15 Zac (12 Muluc). It also = 5916 × 260 + 182.
  The 182, however, the half of the ritual year of 364 days, is the
  interval between IV Ahau and IV Ik and between IV Ik and IV Kan. The fact
  that the interval is the same in each case is clearly the reason for the
  choice of the days IV Kan and IV Ik, which are otherwise not at all
  prominent.</p>

  <p>It is remarkable that the third number is obtained by the addition of
  51,419, <i>i.e.</i>, of 197 × 260 + 199 (there are 199 days between XIII
  Akbal and IV Ik). But it was evidently desirable to obtain as large a
  number as this. On page 63 a number of nearly similar value is associated
  with it, viz:&mdash;1,535,004. It is set down almost in the middle
  between the 13th and 14th Ahau-Katuns, for it is 57,902 days greater than
  1,480,440, and 55,978 days less than 1,594,320. <!-- Page 137 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p>Now, however, the Manuscript presents in the last column but one of
  page 31 a number, 2,804,100, which occupies a very unique position, since
  it is nearly twice as great as all the other large numbers, with the
  exception of those in the serpents. It must refer to the year 9 Muluc,
  and to the date IV Ahau 13 Mol. It has many remarkable properties, for it
  is<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1) = 10,785 × 260</p>

  <p>2) = 17,975 × 156 (156 = IV Kan - IV Ahau).</p>

  <p>3) = 35,950 × 78 (78 = IV Ik - IV Ahau and IV Kan <span
  class="nw">-</span> IV Ik).</p>

  <p>4) = 719 × 3900. We have already met with this 3900 above. Now,
  however, the 2,804,100 by virtue of its magnitude creates the suspicion
  that it may be composed of two ordinary large numbers. It might be</p>

  <p>5) 1,308,580 + 1,495,520, therefore 14,380 (91 + 104).</p>

  <p>6) 1,380,600 + 1,423,500, therefore 3,900 (354 + 365).</p>

  <p>That is to say, the important 3900 multiplied by the days of the lunar
  year and also by those of the solar year, hence the 719, referred to
  under 4, separates into these two parts. The lunar year of 354 = 6 × 29 +
  6 × 30 days was not unknown to the Mayas. We shall find its half, 177
  days, several times on pages 51-58.</p>

  <p>We might also use the two important numbers 14,040 and 18,980, the
  first of which is divisible by 260 and 360, and the second by 260 and
  365, without remainder.</p>

  <p>Then we have the large number desired<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>7) 147 × 18,980 + 14,040.</p>

  <p>8) 200 × 14,040 - 3900.</p>

  <p>What future student will penetrate more deeply into the meaning and
  purpose of these numbers?</p>

  <p>We might now expect to interpret also the upper right-hand corner of
  page 31, but here almost everything is in a deplorable state of
  obliteration. In the first three of the five columns over each of the
  three large numbers there was a date consisting of a numeral and a
  hieroglyph, but these admit of no certain nor even probable
  determination.</p>

  <p>Four hieroglyphs still remain in the fourth column, respecting which
  compare my treatise "Zur Maya-Chronologie" in the Berliner Zeitschrift
  für Ethnologie XXIII, pp. 141-155. <!-- Page 138 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span></p>

  <p>In the top sign I recognize an Imix with a prefix and probably also a
  superfix. I think this denotes the period of 18,980 days.</p>

  <p>I am forced to pass over the second entirely, inasmuch as a red 6
  inserted in it remains a mystery (6 × 18,980 = 113,880?).</p>

  <p>As I stated in the above-named work, I think the third is three times
  the sacred period of 2920, <i>i.e.</i>, 8760 days.</p>

  <p>Finally, the fourth sign certainly denotes the period of 7200
  days.</p>

  <p>Whether or not there was a fifth sign above the one now at the top is
  as uncertain as the meaning of the whole.</p>

  <p>The most remarkable thing about it is that in three other passages of
  this Manuscript these three signs appear in close proximity to another.
  On page 61 we find the third in the 11th place in the second column, the
  first in the 12th place in the same column, and the fourth in the 14th
  place in the first column. Page 70 has the first sign in the middle of
  the 4th column; the second somewhat lower down in the 3d column and the
  4th two places below. Finally all three signs appear in succession on the
  top of page 73 in the same order as on page 31.</p>

  <p>The fifth column on page 31 may have contained another numeral
  belonging to the series, the loss of which is not so serious a matter,
  but there may have been one or two hieroglyphs above it, the obliteration
  of which is greatly to be deplored.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 32a&mdash;39a.</b></p>

  <p>This is a large section extending over eight pages, which is difficult
  of interpretation owing to the prevailing disorder and because a large
  part of the hieroglyphs are effaced. Here, too, the principal subject is
  the god B, who is represented in manifold activity. A series of numbers
  extends through the entire representation. I read them as follows<span

  <p>There are thus 18 divisions, the different lengths of which reveal no
  rule. They embrace 208 days, <i>i.e.</i>, 2 × 104, which may well be
  considered as a continuation of the computation in the preceding section,
  of which the 104 was so important a <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>number. The red numbers
  are entirely lacking in the beginning, then they are very slightly
  indicated, and finally they are distinctly written out on pages 36-39. I
  assume that the scribe has set down the 4th, 3d and 2nd numbers from the
  end, one too little. The last number has been entirely omitted. I have
  supplied these omissions though in a manner somewhat different from that
  adopted by Cyrus Thomas, "Aids," p. 28. I would note in addition that a
  period such as this, consisting of 208 days = 16 weeks, might be
  explained in an entirely different way, if there were a column of five
  days at the left having a difference of 8 days; then the whole would
  signify four Tonalamatls. But there is no such series of days.</p>

  <p>Another point of view presents itself, however. If we take cognizance
  of the fact that a group of four hieroglyphs usually belongs to a
  picture, then it is evident that here there are such groups not for 18,
  but for about 22 subdivisions. It may, therefore, be assumed that about
  four subdivisions averaging 13 days are not specified, in which case this
  passage would extend not over 208, but over 260 days. The very
  irregularity in the arrangement of these numbers is an argument in favor
  of this hypothesis; it may be occasioned by the fact, that the pictures
  do not correspond exactly to the subdivisions. For the present, however,
  we shall discuss the single pictures assuming that there are 18
  subdivisions.</p>

  <p>1. Pages 32a-33a. Here at the very beginning it is uncertain whether
  the signs at the end of page 32 and at the beginning of page 33 are to be
  regarded as a single group of 8 hieroglyphs, as seems to follow from the
  numbers, or as two groups of 4 hieroglyphs each. At the end of page 32 we
  see two persons facing one another, one of whom, to be sure, is barely
  visible. The other wears a head-covering like a man's silk hat, similar
  to that worn by the priests on the inscriptions of Palenque. It is a
  remarkable fact that of the four hieroglyphs above these figures, 1, 2
  and 4 (the last probably the god C) seem to have the sign for the west as
  a prefix, while the prefix of 3 (Imix) suggests the usual representation
  of the tortoise head. Below the persons there is a Kan sign, the prefix
  of which is also the sign for the west. <!-- Page 140 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span></p>

  <p>On page 33, B is represented walking and carrying the Caban sign in
  his hand. The first of the four hieroglyphs is the sign for B, the second
  is Imix, probably again with the sign for the west as a prefix, the third
  is an Akbal sign with Kin, and the fourth is the cross-hatched sign with
  Kan.</p>

  <p>2. The rest of 33a is occupied by two persons, one of whom is clad in
  a gala mantle, but neither admit of further identification. They are
  occupied in fishing, inasmuch as they are sitting on the shore of a body
  of water and are either casting a net or drawing it in. There is a fish
  between them and above it is a vessel with something apparently cooking
  in it. Of the 8 hieroglyphs belonging to this picture, only the following
  are distinguishable:&mdash;the 1st containing an Akbal, the 3d, which is
  the common cross <i>b</i> with a 9, the 4th, an Imix also with 9, and of
  the 7th only the prefix Yax. The 3d and 4th appear again on page 35a, 28
  days later.</p>

  <p>3. Page 34, like page 3, represents a human sacrifice. The victim,
  very vaguely drawn, lies on a step-shaped sacrificial stone, or on the
  pyramid of a teocalli. There is a Caban (earth) sign between the
  sacrifice and the pyramid, and also on the walls of the buildings; the
  shrieking of the victim is plainly indicated. As on page 3, there are
  four persons in the form of gods surrounding the sacrifice, but here they
  are different ones. The one at the left above is the black god (L?),
  holding the rattle-stick (Seler, "Mittelamer. Musikinstrumente," p. 111),
  and at the right, above, F, the companion of the death-god, is sitting
  with a rattle in his hand. Below, the two have changed places, F is on
  the left and L on the right. The former is beating the drum and the
  latter blowing a wind-instrument. The sounds emitted by the two
  instruments are represented by drawings. This may, therefore, be regarded
  as an instrumental quartette. The following objects are also in this
  picture:&mdash;at the left above is a vessel the contents of which are
  cooking; at the left below, another vessel with three Kan signs, and at
  the right above, a Kan sign with a bird's head and below the food known
  to us from pages 27b and 29b. These four objects refer to the sacrificial
  feast. Lastly, at the bottom on the right there is a ladder, probably
  intended for scaling the pyramid. Ten hieroglyphs in <!-- Page 141
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span>the upper line
  belong to this picture:&mdash;the first, which is effaced, is followed by
  a Cauac, then comes the cross <i>b</i>, then a Cimi appropriate to the
  sacrifice, and lastly a head with an Akbal eye, probably D's. The first
  sign in the lower row is likewise destroyed, the second sign is a Kan,
  the next is the cross <i>b</i>, both having a different prefix, then here
  too is the hieroglyph of B with Yax as a prefix, and the last is an
  unknown sign.</p>

  <p>4 and 5. Page 35a. According to the numbers there are two sections
  here, but neither the pictures nor the hieroglyphs can with certainty be
  assigned to either. On the left is a house in which C sits holding a Kan
  sign in his hand; on the roof, as if guarding him, and also holding a Kan
  sign, lies the god B. In the Cort. 24b-25b, there are six gods lying on
  houses, within which other gods are also represented in a recumbent
  position. Then follow two vessels, again denoting the sacrificial feast,
  the contents of which are probably cooking, and which, from the sign on
  the second, are probably liquid. Above these are three others, one with
  the Cimi sign (human flesh?), one with a bird and the third with the
  haunch of venison. At the right of these is an implement, which is
  unfamiliar to me and is similar to that held in the god's hand on pages
  5c and 6c. And quite on the right sits B with foot-prints pictured below
  him and on his clothing.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs on page 35, when they were all legible, numbered 14
  and were arranged in two rows. 4 of the upper row are preserved, the
  lower part of the first is a year-sign (?), similar to that which often
  appears on pages 25-28, the upper element is the cross, and the prefix is
  the one resembling a leaf, which occurs so frequently. The second sign is
  an Imix with a prefixed 9, the third a cross and the fourth a head
  (probably D's) with Akbal. In the second row there is a cross with a
  prefixed 9 (sign of the second or third month?). These two signs with the
  prefixed 9 are perhaps to be read as a calendar date IX Imix 9 Zip (1
  Ix), as on page 33a. Ix, however, belongs to the west, which is the
  predominant cardinal point from 32a onward. The second sign is a compound
  of Kin and Akbal (day and night) which often occurs here, the third is
  the compound of the Moan and Caban signs with the number 1 above each,
  and <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page142"></a>{142}</span>the fourth is the hieroglyph of B. The
  fifth sign is unfamiliar to me. The sixth contains an Imix with the sign
  for the west as a prefix, and the seventh is effaced.</p>

  <p>At this point the representations begin to display a more orderly
  arrangement.</p>

  <p>6. Page 36a. Here the head of B forms the head of a serpent (cf. pages
  61 and 62) represented in pouring rain, while on page 35b it is emerging
  from the water. Of the four hieroglyphs 1 and 2 are entirely and 3 for
  the most part destroyed, and 4 is the usual Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>7. The lightning-beast with flames pouring forth from his forepaws and
  tail, is plunging down from the rectangle, which primarily designates
  stars and then the sky in general. This rectangle occurs for the first
  time here, but will often be met with later. Here it may be a combination
  of Mars and Venus. Of the four hieroglyphs, 1 is effaced, 2 is a compound
  of Kan and Kin, 3 a head with Akbal and Kin (D?) with the uplifted arm as
  a prefix, and 4, corresponding with the picture, is the compound of the
  rain sign Cauac with the prefix of the storm-god K.</p>

  <p>8. Here B himself is the bringer of lightning. In one hand he holds a
  burning torch and flames are bursting from his carrying-frame. The third
  hieroglyph is his sign. It is doubtful whether the fourth is the hatchet
  (machete) or is not rather intended for an ear pierced for the purpose of
  ritual blood-letting, as on pages 44b and 45b; the first and second signs
  are rather indistinct.</p>

  <p>9. Page 37a. Unless I am entirely mistaken, B is here represented with
  his arms bound behind his back. Cf. the pictures on page 2, top, and 60,
  bottom. Are the ends of the rope fluttering in front of the god intended
  to render this still more plain? Hieroglyph 1 contains the sign <i>t</i>,
  which resembles, but is not the same as, the year sign. This sign has
  already occurred frequently, especially on pages 25a-28a, and the last
  time on page 35 in the first hieroglyph. As on page 35, hieroglyph 4 is
  the compound Kin-Cauac, but here it is joined to the year-sign,
  <i>i.e.</i>, it denotes the Kin-Cauac year, just as it does on page 26a.
  3 is again Cauac and 2 is the hieroglyph for B.</p>

  <p>10. Rain is falling from the heavenly shield, already seen on page 36,
  here however designating different planets (Mars and <!-- Page 143
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span>Mercury?) and
  the figure represented in the rain is the one which we have already seen
  on pages 12c, 17a and 21c. It is that of the old Uayeyab god N with a
  hatchet in one hand and an unfamiliar object in the other like the one on
  page 39a, and with another unknown object on his back shaped like a
  shield marked with a Kin. That this figure is really meant to represent N
  follows from the fourth hieroglyph (which, however, is not his regular
  sign 5 Zac), which is repeated on the head of the figure. The lower part
  of the hieroglyph is replaced by the year-sign just as it is in the
  hieroglyph on page 47, left, middle. The third hieroglyph contains 2
  Caban signs, the first and second cannot be clearly identified.</p>

  <p>11. This is a deity which I hardly think appears elsewhere. It has an
  animal's head resembling that of a bear, thus recalling page 7a, and it
  also has the paws of a bear. Of the hieroglyphs only a Kin-Akbal is
  recognizable.</p>

  <p>12. Page 38a. Here we have another heavenly shield (Mars and Venus?)
  and under this shield B is represented seated and strangely enough facing
  himself, the figures not being back to back as on page 68a. Hieroglyphs 1
  to 3 are wholly and 4, which is a head, is for the most part
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>13. B is here represented in very close connection with a female
  figure. Cf. pages 21c-23c. The representation on page 68b is a still
  closer parallel to this passage. The first hieroglyph is destroyed for
  the most part, the second is B, the third is probably only a
  determinative of the latter, but has the sign for the west, and the
  fourth is Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>14. B holding a Kan sign is sitting on an object, which may be meant
  for the stone on which the idols were set up at the change of the year.
  Of the hieroglyphs the third is again B, and the fourth is probably the
  frequent sign <i>a</i>. The first sign is the most remarkable. In the
  Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, Vol. XXIII, p. 147, I stated that this was
  the sign for the change of the year, which is its meaning on pages 41b,
  52b and 68a. The Kan year follows here after the Cauac year of page 37.
  The prefix of the sign is the hieroglyph for the east to which the Kan
  years belong. The Kan sign in B's hand also corresponds to this. The
  second hieroglyph is destroyed. <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span></p>

  <p>15. Page 39. The picture represents the lightning-beast with two
  flaming torches walking under the heavenly shield (Mercury and Jupiter?).
  Of the hieroglyphs the third belongs to B, the fourth has as a prefix the
  sign of the storm-god K, but otherwise admits as little of determination
  as do the first and second.</p>

  <p>16. Here we see B in the rain holding in one hand a machete, and in
  the other a strange implement similar to that on page 37a. Of the
  hieroglyphs the second was the god's sign, the third is <i>a</i>, and the
  fourth may be an Akbal sign with Kin. The first sign somewhat suggests
  the sign for the Moan; its prefix is curious.</p>

  <p>17. Here in place of the picture and the superscription, owing perhaps
  to lack of space and in order not to omit the last picture, we have a
  vertical row of seven hieroglyphs interrupted between the sixth and
  seventh by the red and black numeral belonging here. The top sign is
  effaced and the second is B's. I will not venture to determine the third,
  which contains a Yax. Could it belong to the serpent deity H? The fourth
  is probably Kan-Imix and the fifth is indistinct. And the same is true of
  the sixth, the prefix of which we have already met with as the sixteenth
  hieroglyph on page 24, and shall meet with again on pages 53, 56, 58, 61,
  etc. The seventh sign, which is quite at the bottom, consists of a vessel
  with a foot-print beneath it; it seems to be in the place of the
  picture.</p>

  <p>18. The entire section ends with a picture of B, who carries the
  hatchet and probably the copal pouch. The hieroglyphs are wholly
  obliterated.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 40a&mdash;41a.</b></p>

  <p>The following Tonalamatl, one of the form of 10 × 26, has suffered
  much from the carelessness of the scribe and from injury. I have
  attempted to restore it as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The first row should be read from top to bottom, and then the second
  in the same order. <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span></p>

  <p>The six subdivisions all refer to some activity of B. Among the 6 × 4
  hieroglyphs his sign occurs five times as the fourth and only in the last
  group as the third. Let us now examine the six groups individually.</p>

  <p>1. B is traversing the water in a canoe, as on pages 29c and 40c, with
  the paddle in his hand. All the hieroglyphs belonging to him are
  obliterated.</p>

  <p>2. B is sitting on the laterally elongated head <i>q</i>, which here,
  as on page 69, is enlarged and drawn with special care. Seler ("Charakter
  der aztekischen, etc. Handschrift" in the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie,
  1888, p. 83) discusses this sign in connection with the day Men. It seems
  to me to denote unlucky days, the influence of which may here be checked
  by B. B holds in his hand a hatchet. The head (<i>q</i>) is repeated in
  the third sign, perhaps also in the second, and the superfix of these two
  signs is probably the same as that of the sign beneath the picture of B.
  The first sign is mostly destroyed.</p>

  <p>3. As on pages 30a and 31c, and again just as on page 69a, B is
  sitting on the tree of life or sacrificial tree. A branch of this, which
  he grasps in one hand, ends in a serpent-head, and the root of the tree
  also represents B's head. Around the god's head are again the familiar
  dots, probably signifying stars. Of the hieroglyphs, the first is
  probably <i>f</i>, the second is destroyed, the third may be a variant of
  <i>a</i>, although it recalls the sign which, I believe, has the meaning
  of 73 days on pages 46-50; the prefix of 1 also suggests this
  meaning.</p>

  <p>4. B's head is again surrounded by stars and he holds in one hand the
  outline of a hieroglyph. He is sitting on a peculiar ornamented structure
  resembling the crenelations of a wall. This wall displays the spiral
  which we found also on pages 33b-35b, and which in the treatise, "Zur
  Maya-Chronologie" (Zeitschrift für Ethnologie XXIII, p. 147), I regarded
  as an abbreviation for a serpent and hence as a symbol of time. It is
  further to be noted that B is wet with rain and with this the third
  hieroglyph is in keeping, if it is actually intended to denote the rainy
  season and not the week of 13 days ("Zur Entzifferung" V, 6); still the
  red numeral 13 below is more in keeping with the second meaning. The
  second sign is an Ahau <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page146"></a>{146}</span>with the leaf-shaped prefix, which also
  appears in the first sign of the third group. The first is effaced.</p>

  <p>5. B, represented with a gala mantle hanging down in front and with
  the copal pouch, is sitting on a head, which looks like his own,
  especially as to the eyes, but which notwithstanding probably belongs to
  D and is marked with Ik (wind) and Cauac (cumulus clouds). Of the
  hieroglyphs the first and second do not admit of positive identification,
  and the third is Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>6. The god is sitting on a mat in a house. All the hieroglyphs except
  his own are obliterated.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 42a&mdash;44a.</b></p>

  <p>Another Tonalamatl of the form of 10 × 26; I have restored the effaced
  day-signs as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>
<td class="pr1"> </td>
<td class="pr1"> XIII</td>

<tr><td colspan="2">Cimi</td><td colspan="17">Eb</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">Ezanab</td><td colspan="17">Kan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Thus the month days are the same as in the preceding Tonalamatl, but
  should be read in a different order:&mdash;Oc, Cib, Ik, Lamat, etc.</p>

  <p>Here each of the 8 subdivisions has 6 hieroglyphs, and the order is as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="pr0 ar">2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">3</td><td class="pr0 ar">4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="pr0 ar">6</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>A few of these signs are common to all the groups. Thus the first sign
  (<i>v</i>), as far as what remains is distinguishable, seems to occur in
  all the groups. It has the leaf-shaped prefix, but I cannot understand
  the rest of it; we shall find it again several times on pages
  29c-41c.</p>

  <p>Again the sign in the sixth place, as far as we can see, is always the
  head without an underjaw and the tuft of hair tied up on top of it (O,
  according to Schellhas), which we found above on page 25 and which we
  shall meet again on pages 65-69 no less than 13 times, with regular
  intervals of 6 signs between them. Indeed that passage is a remarkable
  parallel to this one.</p>

  <p>That the sign for B, who here too plays the most important part,
  occurs often, is self-evident. It appears in the fourth <!-- Page 147
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>place, in the
  1st, 3d, 4th, and 7th groups, and in the third of the 8th group; in the
  6th group it is destroyed. In the 2nd and 5th groups B has neither
  picture nor sign.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs of the cardinal points I shall mention in connection
  with the separate groups. They are especially conspicuous in this
  section, being sometimes represented in full and sometimes in an
  abbreviated form as mere prefixes.</p>

  <p>1. B with arms crossed sits above a serpent denoting time, and holding
  in its coils the cross <i>b</i>, which so often refers to astronomical
  conditions. Above the head of the serpent is the vessel with the three
  Kan signs, which we have already found several times on pages 25-28. It
  is remarkable that the flourish, which usually appears as the
  nose-ornament of the sun-god G (<i>e.g.</i>, pages 11b and c), is added
  to these Kan signs. As the stars are again indicated on B's head, he
  plainly denotes a time-god here. The third hieroglyph, the sign of the
  east, corresponds with this meaning, and the Kan sign, which we see in
  the fifth hieroglyph probably combined with Ahau, also belongs to the
  east; the prefix of the fourth hieroglyph is the sign for the west.</p>

  <p>2. A deity whom we shall probably have to call F, the god of human
  sacrifice, is sitting on a stepped pyramidal structure (a teocalli as a
  place of sacrifice?). He holds something in his hands, resembling a long
  and broad scroll, joined to which is the head of the god of the north, C,
  and in the third hieroglyph of this group the sign for the north also
  appears, prefixed to the head of F, who seems to be repeated in the
  fourth hieroglyph. The fifth hieroglyph with an Imix is unintelligible to
  me.</p>

  <p>3. Page 43. B is sitting in the water, the copal pouch hangs from his
  neck and the hatchet is raised as if ready to attack. The second
  hieroglyph clearly denotes water, while the third is the sign for the
  west and the fourth is the sign for B, its prefix being the sign for the
  east abbreviated; the order of the cardinal points is thus exactly the
  reverse of that in the first group. The fifth hieroglyph is not clear to
  me, but it appears to be repeated in the same place in the next
  group.</p>

  <p>4. B is sitting here astride a sort of bench again holding the hatchet
  in his hand. Belonging to this picture in the third <!-- Page 148
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span>hieroglyph is
  the sign for the south, which is repeated in an abbreviated form in the
  fourth hieroglyph.</p>

  <p>The fifth is Kan, joined to what appears to be the same sign as the
  one found in this place in the preceding group. The second sign is
  indistinct.</p>

  <p>5. This is an aged deity, probably M according to Schellhas, seated on
  an indefinite object. In front of the deity is a Cauac sign, which
  contains exactly the same cumulus clouds as those in the sign 5 Zac,
  which belongs to N. Cauac, however, belongs to the south, and therefore
  corresponds with the north of the second group on page 42. Sign 5, a Kan,
  corresponds exactly with the same sign in the fifth place of the
  preceding group.</p>

  <p>6. Page 44. B seems to be in a state of collapse. Behind him is a
  second person, who is either trying to support him or to pull him up by
  some kind of a sling. I think the second person is E, the grain-deity, if
  it is not Seler's young god. If the hieroglyphs were not completely
  effaced, they would probably shed some light on this interesting
  passage.</p>

  <p>7. Here we see B, holding a fish in his hand, and sitting on a
  hieroglyph, which is compounded of Imix and a prefix, which resembles the
  tortoise head and which appeared once before in this combination on page
  32a. This passage recalls page 40a, where B is seated on the laterally
  elongated head <i>q</i>. Nothing more can be said of the hieroglyphs,
  than that 6 is the head without an underjaw.</p>

  <p>8. B is sitting here in a house; his sign in the third place has Yax
  as a prefix. Hieroglyph 5, with the number 4 prefixed, recalls the one
  which we found on page 21c belonging to the baldheaded old man.
  Hieroglyph 4 is the common Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p><b>Page 45a.</b></p>

  <p>The last page on the front of the first section of this Manuscript is
  used for a series, which presents itself as a second improved edition of
  the series which was found on pages 31a-32a. The very fact that the
  writing is so much better proclaims it an amendment. The chief aim of
  both series is the same, viz:&mdash;to bring into unison the numbers 91,
  104, 260 and 364. But the two series gain this end by different means. On
  page 32 the <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page149"></a>{149}</span>series begins with 91, and at first has
  only 91 as a difference, until with 728 a multiple of 104 and 364 is
  obtained, then it returns to the simple difference 91, in 1456 it obtains
  again the 104 and 364, loses these two last numbers once more in 1820 and
  finally in 3640 obtains the desired multiple of all four numbers, which
  is retained in 7280, 14,560, 21,840 and 29,120. The series on page 45a
  proceeds much more briefly. It begins at once with 728 (91, 104, 364),
  loses the 104 in 1092, gains the 260 and loses the 104 in 1820, arrives
  at divisibility by all four numbers in the 3640, loses the 104 again in
  5460, but then comes to a standstill after having obtained the same
  multiples (double at that) of 3640, which I mentioned just now in the
  preceding series. Indeed it can be seen from what is legible in the third
  column above, that the series went still further. But so much is
  obliterated that I have obtained the numbers 14,560 and 21,840 in both
  series only by conjecture.</p>

  <p>In the earlier passage the starting-point of the series is the day
  XIII Akbal and in the one before us it is the day XIII Oc. In the former
  the days specified were 91 days apart from each other, and here they are
  separated by 104, <i>i.e.</i>, XIII Ezanab, XIII Ik, XIII Cimi, XIII
  Oc.</p>

  <p>The initial days of the two series, XIII Oc-XIII Akbal, are separated
  by 13 days, and the reversed series, XIII Akbal-XIII Oc, by 247 days.
  Hence the subject of both passages is essentially the week of thirteen
  days, <i>i.e.</i>, the year of 364 (28 × 13) days.</p>

  <p>Now this series is also accompanied by a number amounting to millions.
  It is in the second column of page 45; only, in order to understand it,
  we must add a zero as the bottom figure; then it becomes 1,278,420. XIII
  Oc stands below this number as the beginning of the series. The first
  column has 30 as an encircled number and below it the normal day IV
  Ahau.</p>

  <p>The large number must have been formed as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The point of departure was 230, the interval between IV Ahau and XIII
  Oc, to this was added 98 × 260 = 25,480, the sum being 25,710. The result
  of this number added to 11 Ahau-Katuns = 1,252,680, was 1,278,390, which
  number is not <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span>revealed in the Manuscript. It is
  concealed in XIII Oc 3 Mol (2 Muluc). But 1,278,390 = 42,613 × 30,
  <i>i.e.</i>, it is divisible by the interval XIII Oc-IV Ahau.</p>

  <p>Now if we add to this large number the 30 set down in the Manuscript,
  the result will be the above-mentioned 1,278,420. This number in the
  Manuscript has the date IV Ahau 13 Chen. (2 Muluc). It is, of course,
  divisible by 30 and by 260, hence = 42,614 × 30 and 4917 × 260. It
  corresponds not merely in this respect with the largest number on page
  31a, viz:&mdash;2,804,100, but also with regard to its divisibility by
  78, 156, 195, which are all multiples of 13.</p>

  <p>On page 45a, top left, there were doubtless five hieroglyphs, of which
  the two topmost ones are effaced. First we see only the sign of the
  eleventh or twelfth month, Zac or Ceh, with an uncertain number prefixed,
  then the signs for beginning and end are distinctly legible. Ceh begins
  and Zac ends the year of 364 days; see page 4 of my treatise "Zur
  Entzifferung V."</p>

  <p>We come now to the middle section of pages 29-45, in which we shall
  not be so hampered by obliteration in our attempts at interpretation, as
  we were in the upper section.</p>

  <p>That is to say, the 52 days divided into four equal parts.</p>

  <p>To these four divisions, as on page 23b, belong the four usual forms
  of animal food, which are joined in three places to Kan (bread) and
  probably denote sacrifice. They are, first a mammal, which, however, is
  erroneously represented by a fish; second, a fish, third an iguana and
  lastly a bird. I would add, that in the hieroglyphs above, the east,
  north, west and south correspond in turn with these representations of
  food. <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page151"></a>{151}</span></p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs are arranged as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Of these, 2, 6, 10 and 14 are the cardinal points just mentioned; 4,
  8, 12 and 16 are the sign for B, and 1, 5, 9 and 13 are the head with the
  tuft of hair and the Akbal eye to which I attribute the meaning of
  <i>beginning</i>. Likewise the remaining four signs, 3, 7, 11 and 15,
  although they are not exactly alike, have something in common, the 15th
  being a distinct Imix; they are not yet wholly intelligible to me.</p>

  <p>Four pictures of B belong to these hieroglyphs. In the first the god
  is seated with crossed arms on two of the ordinary astronomical signs
  (Jupiter and Mars?). In the second, where he is pointing forward with his
  hand, there are footprints on his seat, as, for example, on page 35a. In
  the third the seat contains the usual cumulus clouds in clusters.
  Finally, in the fourth, he is seated on the tree of life or of sacrifice,
  the hatchet is in his hand and he is clad in the gala mantle; cf. pages
  31c, 40a, 69a.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 30b&mdash;31b.</b></p>

  <p>This passage is in some respects closely related to the preceding
  Tonalamatl, but in other respects it differs significantly from this and
  from what is usual, for the Tonalamatl is divided here into only four
  principal divisions of 65 days each, which begin very regularly with the
  days VIII Oc, VIII Men, VIII Ahau and VIII Chicchan. There are neither
  subdivisions nor the usual pictures belonging to them. But on the other
  hand each of the longer periods of time written down here have eight
  hieroglyphs for each section in the usual order.</p>

  <p>B's sign occupies the places 6, 4, 4 and 4; from this it follows that
  here too he forms the principal subject.</p>

  <p>Here, as in the preceding Tonalamatl, the first place in each group
  contains the sign denoting beginning, while the eighth sign is invariably
  the head without an underjaw, which seems to me to refer to
  <i>fasting</i>, as if a fast-day fell at the end of every 65 days. <!--
  Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span></p>

  <p>In the fifth place we see in succession the four animals, which in the
  preceding Tonalamatl are not included in the groups of hieroglyphs. Here
  they stand in the order of mammal, bird, amphibian and fish, but the bird
  in the second group is replaced by the sign which usually occurs with the
  dog (lightning-beast).</p>

  <p>The signs in the second place are those of the cardinal points, and
  they are given in the same order as in the preceding Tonalamatl,
  <i>i.e.</i>, east, north, west and south, so that they do not belong to
  the same animals as they do there.</p>

  <p>The third signs are the cardinal points again, but in the abbreviated
  form discovered first by Schellhas, and in a different order:&mdash;west,
  north, east and south, and always joined to the head of C around which
  everything revolves as around the polar star. The Kan sign with different
  accompanying signs occupies the seventh place in the first group, and the
  sixth in the other three.</p>

  <p>Four signs still remain:&mdash;the fourth of the first group I am
  inclined to consider the abbreviated sign for the sun; the seventh of the
  second, rain with the sign for the west as a prefix; the seventh of the
  third, Caban, ground, with the sign for the east as a prefix; the seventh
  of the fourth is Kan with the Yax sign above it, probably denoting the
  vegetable kingdom.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 31b&mdash;35b.</b></p>

  <p>This entire passage is devoted to a single Tonalamatl, which is
  divided and written out in an unusual manner. Like the preceding it is
  divided into four parts of 65 days each, but the remarkable thing about
  it is that these divisions of 65 days are each subdivided into two
  periods of 46 and 19 days, and the 46 days again into eight unequal
  parts, which are exactly the same each time, while the 19 days run their
  course without further subdivision. On pages 33, 34 and 35 this 19 is
  always on the left at the bottom, on page 32 it is wanting, probably
  because it was self-evident and there was no suitable place for it.</p>

  <p>We shall next discuss the division of these four periods of 46 days
  each. This division is indicated with especial exactness on these pages,
  since not merely the length of the separate <!-- Page 153 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>{153}</span>divisions and the week
  days are specified, but also the month days. This representation has the
  additional peculiarity, that the two columns on each page must be read
  from bottom to top, and of each group of two days standing side by side,
  the one on the right is to be read first and then the one on the left. If
  the Tonalamatl were written in the usual manner, it would have the
  following form<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In spite of the seemingly wholly irregular division of time, the
  following relation, which is certainly not accidental, results from this
  arrangement:&mdash;the first of the eight members of each row is one of
  the days which may begin the year and the months, and the eighth, on the
  other hand, one of the four regents of the year. The remaining six
  members are the remaining 12 of the 20 days repeated twice and the second
  always corresponds with the fifth of its own series, and the third to the
  sixth and the fourth to the seventh of the following series.</p>

  <p>Two pictures of god B belong to each of these periods of 65 days, the
  first of these pictures referring to the divided period of 46 days and
  the second to the undivided one of 19. It is also in agreement with this
  that on pages 61 and 62 the fourth, sixth and eighth pictures represent
  the god as rising from the jaws of a serpent&mdash;the serpent being
  represented each time as lying in water which invariably contains the
  number 19. <!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page154"></a>{154}</span></p>

  <p>As the hieroglyphs belonging to the periods of 46 days are allied to
  one another, and as this is also true of those belonging to the periods
  of 19 days, I will first consider the hieroglyphs of the first period by
  themselves, then those of the second, and the pictures shall be treated
  in the same manner.</p>

  <p>Therefore, let us first examine the four pictures (1, 3, 5 and 7) on
  the right side of the pages<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The first page shows the god walking with the official staff in his
  right hand, in his left the hatchet raised for a blow and with the copal
  pouch hanging from his neck.</p>

  <p>2. He is walking and holding a flaming torch reversed in his right
  hand, in his left the hatchet is raised aloft, the pouch hangs from his
  neck, the mantle is indicated and around his head are the little circles
  which are so frequently his adjuncts and probably signify stars.</p>

  <p>3. He is walking and holding the reversed torch in his left hand and
  the hatchet in his right.</p>

  <p>4. He is walking and holding a torch in each hand. He wears on his
  head the head of K. He seems to be bringing storm and fire.</p>

  <p>Now let us examine the hieroglyphs, which I have numbered thus<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="ar">3</td><td class="pr0 ar">5</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">2</td><td class="ar">4</td><td class="pr0 ar">6</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The first hieroglyph on each page certainly represents one of the
  cardinal points. They are in the usual order:&mdash;east, north, south
  and west.</p>

  <p>2 is the same sign on each page. I take it to be the sign for Xul =
  end, denoting, it may be, the end of the period of each cardinal
  point.</p>

  <p>In each group 3 is the head with tuft of hair and the Akbal eye;
  probably the sign denoting <i>beginning</i>. This beginning and end occur
  most distinctly repeated on page 63, and the end alone eight times at the
  bottom of pages 61-62.</p>

  <p>On page 31, 4 is B's sign, on page 32 B's with the prefix of the
  north, on page 33 it is B's sign again and although quite <!-- Page 155
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>indistinct its
  is plainly joined with the east. On page 34 there is another indistinct
  sign which may be that of the serpent deity H.</p>

  <p>Owing to indistinctness I do not venture to determine the fifth sign
  on pages 31 and 33; on page 32 it is the laterally elongated head
  <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik superfix, and on page 34 the ordinary
  Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>The sixth sign varies as much as the fifth; it seems here to denote
  four different gods, perhaps the four given on pages 25-28. On page 31 it
  is a Cauac, the prefix of which here, however, suggests K, on 32 it is
  certainly the hieroglyph of E and on 33 possibly of A, on 34 it most
  resembles Muluc of the day-signs, but also suggests the line crossing F's
  face from top to bottom.</p>

  <p>We come now to the four pictures 2, 4, 6 and 8 and to the hieroglyphs
  belonging to them, which are on the left side of the pages and belong to
  the periods of 19 days.</p>

  <p>1. B is pictured walking, raising the hatchet in his right hand, and
  holding an uncertain object in his left; the serpent with the 19 set down
  in its coils does not appear here. The 2nd, 3d and 4th pictures belong
  together. In each picture on these three pages there is a serpent with
  water in its coils and the number 19 in the water, denoting the number of
  days belonging here. As on pages 61 and 62 B is emerging from the open
  jaws of the serpent. In each case he is brandishing the uplifted axe in
  his left hand. The difference in the three pictures consists, first, in
  the fact that only in the 2nd and 3d B wears the copal pouch, second,
  that only in the 3d and 4th he has an implement in his right hand (the
  two implements differ somewhat but are both, apparently, adapted for
  hanging up) and third, that only in 3 the whole picture is painted blue,
  which means that the entire scene is enacted under water.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs are as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The first in all four cases is a Manik, <i>i.e.</i>, originally a
  grasping hand, perhaps referring to the chase; on page 32 it has a prefix
  and on pages 33-35 a superfix corresponding to the first.</p>

  <p>The second sign on each page is simply B's.</p>

  <p>The Cauac sign in the third refers in all four cases to the <!-- Page
  156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>{156}</span>water
  represented at the bottom of pages 33b-35b. On page 32 it has an Akbal as
  a superfix, on 33-35 a prefix, which is familiar and in keeping with the
  sign and probably also the same suffix, though it is indistinct on page
  34.</p>

  <p>The fourth sign shows, as do several other things, that the
  representation on page 32 differs from that on pages 33-35. On the first
  of these pages we see an Imix with a puzzling 1 prefixed. If the
  numbering of the days really begins with Kan, as is probable in this
  Manuscript, then Imix is the 18th day and 1 + 18 might denote the 19,
  which is not set down here. On pages 33-35 this sign contains the spiral,
  which refers to the serpent in the picture below (and probably therefore
  to time). A curious element, however, is the numeral 9 prefixed three
  times to the spiral. This number is rarely a prefix, but it occurs, for
  example, on pages 33a and 35a before the cross <i>b</i> and on page 60
  right, middle, prefixed to Xul (= end). The interval 9 occurs in this
  Tonalamatl 16 times, including therefore 117 of the 260 days.</p>

  <p>The fifth sign each time contains the head without the under jaw, just
  as it recurs regularly in the preceding passage, pages 30-31.</p>

  <p>The sixth sign in each group is the not uncommon compound of Caban and
  the sign, which resembles Muluc and which we saw before in the sixth
  place among the hieroglyphs on the right side of page 34.</p>

  <p>That is, a regular Tonalamatl of five parts, 5 × 52. That the 52 days
  are divided into two halves (11 + 6 + 9 = 4 + 7 + 9 + 6), may only be
  accidental.</p>

  <p>I will designate the hieroglyphs of the seven divisions thus<span

  <p>I will first consider those signs, which are repeated and by means of
  which the sections seem to be brought into connection <!-- Page 157
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>with one
  another. But I shall attend in detail to those hieroglyphs which contain
  characteristic references to each picture, when I discuss the latter.</p>

  <p>The first place both among the pictures and among the hieroglyphs
  again belongs unquestionably to B. He is plainly designated in the 10th,
  17th, 21st and 26th hieroglyphs, but, for an unknown reason, C's sign is
  joined to B's in the 16th, probably also in the 6th and perhaps in the
  9th, and in 20 and 28 C's sign forms an integral part of a hieroglyph.
  Now in discussing the great Tonalamatl, pages 4a-10a, I attempted to make
  it appear probable that C belongs to the eighth day (Chuen) and in that
  case the Chuen sign in the thirteenth hieroglyph may be probably set down
  here. Further, in discussing pages 25 to 28, I expressed the conjecture
  that this Chuen sign might simply mean eight days, if we begin with Kan
  as the first day, for which proceeding there is some warrant in the
  "Dresdensis." Now, in hieroglyphs 8 and 24 we find an 8 inscribed; in
  hieroglyph 8 it is joined to an Imix, exactly as on page 39c; on page 65a
  it is joined to Kin, and on 67a and 68a to a hand. Is it possible that
  here also the 8 is intended as a sign for Chuen = C?</p>

  <p>Then the familiar Kin-Akbal sign (day and night) is in the fourth
  place as well as in the eleventh and nineteenth.</p>

  <p>The other signs which appear but once, I will discuss in connection
  with each of the seven pictures<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. A serpent in the water, with B emerging from its head, exactly as
  on pages 36a, Tro. 26 and Cort. 10.</p>

  <p>The third sign, that of the serpent-deity H, refers to the serpent.
  The first sign is the one which I think may be Caban-Muluc, while the
  second, owing to its indistinctness, eludes interpretation.</p>

  <p>2. This also represents a deity sitting in the water, whom we are
  probably safe in calling H, for the top of his head changes into a
  serpent, ending, however, in a bird's bill holding a fish. The deity
  holds up both hands. The union of serpent and bird should be noted in
  connection with the fourth picture. The deity is represented in the fifth
  sign; the sixth, seventh and eighth signs have already been discussed.
  <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page158"></a>{158}</span></p>

  <p>3. B is traversing the water in a boat, exactly as on pages 29c, 40a
  and c, and 43c. Here, however, there is a person beside him (probably a
  woman) whom, from the ninth hieroglyph we recognize as the deity E,
  unless this sign is C's. In 12 we see with Kan a sign which may suggest
  the usual hieroglyph denoting a year.</p>

  <p>4. A serpent is pictured here, with a bird sitting upon it. We met
  with the same bird on page 17b. Schellhas, "Maya-handschr.," p. 51, has
  already expressed the opinion that this is probably a rebus for the name
  Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan, and this theory is certainly worthy of
  consideration. In this connection I would call to mind that it is
  probably also Kukulcan with serpent and bird who occupies the first place
  on page 4a. The bird appears again in the fourteenth sign, while the
  thirteenth is a Chuen, which, according to the statement made above, may
  be connected with the C in the sixteenth. The fifteenth sign is the cross
  <i>b</i>, which probably denotes the connection between the thirteenth
  and sixteenth or else between the bird and serpent. Or is Chuen intended
  here to represent the serpent and not the ape?</p>

  <p>5. This picture represents B carrying a burning torch, with the copal
  pouch hanging from his neck. His left hand touches a strange object, a
  kind of frame, the top of which ends in the head of a bird of prey.</p>

  <p>The eighteenth sign is obliterated and the twentieth is a curious
  combination of Caban, C and the front part of K.</p>

  <p>6. B is walking, with the hatchet in his left hand and in his right an
  object which looks like the representation of sounds issuing from musical
  instruments, as on page 34a. Perhaps B is represented here as the
  air-god.</p>

  <p>The twenty-second sign is the familiar Kan-Imix. The twenty-third sign
  (<i>w</i>) is not intelligible to me; it occurs on pages 19c, 40b, 58, on
  the right, with a superfix suggesting K.</p>

  <p>7. Water, in which a small human being seems to be emerging from a
  snail (the symbol of birth). Above the water is B, grasping a serpent
  which is in the water, as if to protect the new-born being from the
  serpent. The twenty-fifth (with Kin) is the so-called bat-god, who on
  page 50 at the left ends the series <!-- Page 159 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page159"></a>{159}</span>of twenty gods. The
  twenty-seventh sign (with Yax) is still undetermined.</p>

  <p>The sum of the black numbers is 104, the whole is, therefore, a double
  Tonalamatl = 5 × 104 = 520. While the series on pages 31a-32a primarily
  brought the 91 and the 104 together, and the series on page 45a
  accomplished the same result with the 104 and the 364, here, though the
  process is a different one, the 104 is combined with the 260 in another
  number.</p>

  <p>It is characteristic of this part of the Manuscript, that the
  astronomical rectangles, which are very rare in the preceding pages,
  appear here in no less than five of the eleven divisions and six of them
  represent showers of rain. One is very readily, therefore, led to infer
  that the 104 days have reference to the rainy season and to its
  dependence upon the position of the planets. I will now analyse the
  eleven sections separately.</p>

  <p>1. Rain is streaming down from two astronomical signs (Mars and
  Jupiter? Day and night?) and in the rain stands a black human form,
  grasping an implement with the right hand held downward and pointing
  upward with the left. It has the vulture head which occurred on pages 8a
  and 13c.</p>

  <p>Hieroglyphs 1 and 2 represent the sun and moon, both surrounded by
  half white and half black envelopes, which must denote clouds. The third
  sign is Imix, which just here might refer to the rainy season productive
  of nourishment. The fourth sign is the vulture head of the picture.</p>

  <p>2. B is walking in the rain and holds in one hand a stick pointed at
  the lower end. This is doubtless a farming implement, likewise occurring
  frequently in the Tro-Cort., which was used for making furrows or holes
  in the ground.</p>

  <p>The second hieroglyph is B's, the first is Caban = earth, the fourth
  might be a compound of Caban and Muluc, referring to the rain, and the
  third is the familiar Kan-Imix, which, as the designation of food and
  drink, would be especially appropriate here. <!-- Page 160 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>{160}</span></p>

  <p>3. B is apparently resting from tilling the soil, since he is sitting
  on a support consisting of the signs just spoken of, <i>i.e.</i>, Caban
  and Muluc (?).</p>

  <p>The latter signs are repeated in the second hieroglyph, while the
  third is B's with the sun-glyph (?) prefixed; the first is the head
  apparently open on top with the Akbal eye, probably the sign for
  beginning, and the fourth is the familiar sign <i>a</i>, which I think
  signifies a good, auspicious day.</p>

  <p>4. Page 39. This represents a violent shower of rain, which might be
  pronounced a cloud-burst. The old red goddess with tiger-claws and a
  serpent on her head is pouring water in a stream from a jug. The same
  goddess occurs on page 43b and on the last page, 74.</p>

  <p>Her hieroglyph is the second; it is more distinct in the two other
  passages. The first part of the third hieroglyph is indistinct, and the
  second part is the hieroglyph denoting the year. The first hieroglyph is
  a head with the Akbal sign, and the fourth is the usual compound of Kin
  and Akbal.</p>

  <p>5. The cloud-burst seems to have destroyed the cultivation of the
  field, for B walks forth again with the implement for tilling the soil,
  as in the second picture. The second hieroglyph is B's with the prefix of
  the west, therefore probably denoting sunshine, the first again contains
  Caban and Muluc and the fourth is Kan-Imix referring again to the produce
  of the field. I shall not venture to explain the third sign here any more
  than I did in the previous passages. Compare page 8b.</p>

  <p>6. B is again sitting in the rain and under the same astronomical
  signs as before on page 38. He is pointing downward (to the sprouting
  seed?). He has the sun-glyph on his back. The first two hieroglyphs are
  unfamiliar to me (Yax); the third is Imix with the sign for the west, and
  the fourth is again Muluc.</p>

  <p>7. Page 40. B is plunging down headfirst from the same astronomical
  signs and is brandishing the hatchet.</p>

  <p>Hieroglyph 1 is the cross <i>b</i>, 2 is B's sign, 3 probably that of
  the grain-god E, and 4 being Kan-Imix refers to grain. Favorable weather
  seems to have set in.</p>

  <p>8. The astronomical signs are not the same as those in the three
  preceding instances (Mercury and sun?). Below them <!-- Page 161 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>{161}</span>is a deity with
  tortoise-head&mdash;in my opinion, the sign for the longest
  day&mdash;holding a torch in each hand and thus referring to the
  heat.</p>

  <p>Hieroglyph 1 (<i>w</i>) with the superfix suggesting K still puzzles
  me. 2 is the cross <i>b</i>, 3 is the tortoise-head with the number 4,
  which probably refers to the Kan, Muluc, Ix and Cauac years, as the 4
  sometimes appears prefixed to N's hieroglyph. In exactly the same way the
  tortoise-head with the tortoise itself occurs frequently in the
  Cortesianus. 4 is the sign of the year with prefixed Kin and Cauac,
  <i>i.e.</i>, day-Cauac-year.</p>

  <p>9. A thunder-storm, which is very appropriate after the longest day.
  The lightning-beast, likewise holding a burning torch, is plunging down
  from the astronomical signs, which are different ones again (Venus and
  the moon?).</p>

  <p>The second hieroglyph contains the sign of the dog together with the
  cross <i>b</i>, while the third is that of the north-god C, and the
  fourth is Muluc. I cannot explain the first sign; its prefix, which
  rarely occurs, appears also on pages 23b, 25a, 37b, 63a, and possibly on
  pages 53b, 62-63a, 69b.</p>

  <p>10. Page 41. Another representation of rain. There is an old deity in
  the rain, who is N rather than F, denoting the end of the old year. He is
  emerging from a snail (cf. with this page 37b), and is pointing upward; a
  part of the first hieroglyph is on his head.</p>

  <p>This first hieroglyph recalls the sign which, in the Zeitschrift für
  Ethnologie, XXIII, p. 145, I ventured to connect with the change of the
  year; but it also suggests the snail pictured below, hence the birth of
  the new year. The beginning of the year for the Mayas, although of course
  not for all parts of the country, is fixed, as a rule, to fall on the
  16th of July. This would agree admirably with the eighth and ninth
  sections, which represent the time of the longest day and of
  thunder-storms.</p>

  <p>The second hieroglyph is B's, the fourth the cross <i>b</i>, probably
  referring here to a union of two years, and the third with its Cauac to
  the duration of the rainy season or to the god N.</p>

  <p>11. The rain seems to fall with less violence. B is seated, clad in
  the gala mantle with a Kan on his head, as the sign of grain. His
  headdress also strongly recalls that of the <!-- Page 162 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>{162}</span>grain-deity E (which is
  also the case of the headdress on the preceding picture.)</p>

  <p>Hieroglyph 1, the upper part of which is very like that of the first
  sign of the preceding group, looks like a plaited mat. Does it not
  suggest that the name of the first month of the new year is Pop and that
  this word is denoted by carpet, mat? Hieroglyph 2 is B's, 3 is the sun
  between a dark and a bright sky, and 4 is the common Kin-Akbal, day and
  night.</p>

  <p>If the seventh picture really refers to the beginning of the year,
  then the entire period of 104 days extends from April 15th to August 2nd,
  which, with the addition of the five days not counted at the end of the
  year, does indeed make 109 days. All this, however, is only true on the
  supposition that I have not seen more in these representations than they
  contain.</p>

  <p>Another regular Tonalamatl, and like the preceding one apparently
  referring to the change of the year, the tilling of the soil and the
  rainy season. B's sign is regularly repeated in the second place of all
  five groups of hieroglyphs, and moreover each of these groups has six
  signs. The head with the missing under jaw is in the fourth place of
  groups 2 and 3, in the sixth of group 5 and might perhaps be intended
  also in the fourth of 1 and 4. The usual Kan-Imix is in the third sign of
  group 2, in the fifth of 4, and the fourth of 5; possibly also in the
  fifth of 1; the third hieroglyph in group 3, at any rate, contains
  Imix.</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the five groups individually<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The rainy season seems to have been delayed; the beginning of the
  year draws near. B is kneeling on a kind of footstool, the hatchet is in
  his right hand and his left hand holds a kind of chisel with which he is
  carving something out of the trunk of a tree. The purpose of the work is
  indicated by the god's own head directly below (probably placed in front
  of the tree as a model?). No doubt this is intended to represent the
  making of the statue of the god of the new year destined for the
  beginning of the year, as we know it from pages 25-28. <!-- Page 163
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span></p>

  <p>Corresponding with this is the first hieroglyph denoting the year with
  Yax as a superfix, and also the sixth being the sign to which in the
  article in the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie cited above, I attributed the
  meaning of change of the year. I cannot decide whether the third sign is
  intended for an Imix-Chuen with the sign of the south as a superfix, the
  fifth for a Kan-Imix and the fourth for the head without the under
  jaw.</p>

  <p>2. Page 42. Prayer for rain. B (that is to say, his priest) is seated
  apparently on the same footstool. He is gazing upward and presenting a
  vessel containing an offering, the nature of which is uncertain. The
  vessel ends in a tube; cf. page 67b.</p>

  <p>The first, fifth and sixth hieroglyphs are not finished, and the third
  is Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>3. The rain-goddess promises aid. B is seated opposite the old red
  goddess, who is holding intercourse with him. The god is seated on the
  Caban sign (earth) and the goddess on Muluc (rain?).</p>

  <p>The first, fifth and sixth hieroglyphs are also unfinished; the third
  is Imix with its meaning intensified by the prefixed Yax (the luxuriantly
  growing grain?).</p>

  <p>4. B is again tilling the ground in the manner already familiar to us.
  Under him lies his own head with the Imix-Kan sign, denoting food and
  drink, as a superfix. The first hieroglyph is the sign of the eighteenth
  month Cumhu, <i>i.e.</i>, of the end of the year. The third is a
  Kin-Akbal, the fifth a Kan-Imix, the sixth is not finished, and the
  fourth may be intended for the head without the lower jaw, but it is
  carelessly drawn.</p>

  <p>5. Page 43. The solicited rain begins. The goddess with the serpent on
  her head is pouring streams of water from her vessel.</p>

  <p>The first hieroglyph repeats the month Cumhu, denoting the beginning
  of rain, before the close of the year; the third is the sign of the
  goddess met with on page 39b, here also with the sign for the west as a
  prefix; the fifth is her determinative, the serpent, and the fourth is
  Kan-Imix.</p>

  <p>If the first sign in the first group is not regarded as the sign of
  the year, but as that of the sixteenth month (Pax) resembling <!-- Page
  164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>{164}</span>it, and
  the fact is taken into consideration that there is an interval of 34 days
  between the second and fourth groups and of 40 days between the second
  and fifth, this would be found to correspond with the interval between
  the months Pax and Cumhu.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 43b&mdash;44b.</b></p>

  <p>This is the fourth and last series of the first part of the
  Manuscript; the first is on page 24, the second on pages 31a to 32a, and
  the third on page 45a. The first series is quite by itself, but the
  second and third are similar in form to this fourth, though their initial
  days are different from those of the latter:&mdash;XIII Akbal, XIII Oc
  and III Lamat. All three begin with differences which are divisible by
  13:&mdash;91, 104 and 78, equal to 7, 8, and 6 × 13. All three aim and
  arrive at numbers which are common factors of 260, 104 and 364, and
  therefore also of 3640, which last number is written out in the other two
  series, while in this series it can only appear later on and then,
  increased by multiplication.</p>

  <p>Since this series has the difference 78, the week day numbers remain
  the same, while those of the month days must advance by 18 each, that is,
  from the hidden starting-point III Lamat they go on to III Cimi, III Kan,
  III Ik, III Ahau, etc., until the tenth member of the series is 10 × 78,
  <i>i.e.</i>, 3 × 260 and thus comes again to the day III Lamat.</p>

  <p>From 780 onward this number is itself always the difference of the
  higher terms of the present series. At the same time 780 days are the
  duration of the apparent revolution of Mars, which is here supplementary,
  as it were, since page 24 treated of the revolutions of the sun and of
  Venus, and also of those of the moon and of Mercury. Hence in the present
  passage we find the numbers 1560, 2340, 3120 and 3900, always accompanied
  by the day III Lamat. The larger numbers require a few corrections; I
  read them 13,260 (17 × 780), 15,600 (20 × 780), 31,200 (40 × 780), 62,400
  (80 × 780) and 72,540 (93 × 780). The very largest again are correctly
  set down; first 109,200 equal to 140 × 780, but here also equal to 1050 ×
  104 and 300 × 364, so that in this series the goal aimed at is not
  reached until later than it is in <!-- Page 165 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>{165}</span>the two preceding
  series. Then follows 131,040 = 168 × 780, 1260 × 104, 360 × 364, but
  finally 151,320, which number = 1455 × 104 and 194 × 780, but is not
  divisible by 364.</p>

  <p>Detached in the usual way from this series on the left of page 43 is
  the number 1,435,980. Above and below it is the day III Lamat, further
  down IV Ahau, and between them is 352 in a red circle. This number seems
  to have been obtained in the following way:&mdash;The writer began with
  the distance between III Lamat and IV Ahau, which is 92, added to it 172
  × 260 = 44,720, and subtracted the result 44,812 from 13 Ahau-Katuns =
  1,480,440. The remainder was 1,435,628, which number would correspond to
  the date III Lamat 6 Zotz (4 Kan), which, however, is suppressed in the
  Manuscript. The 352 = 260 + 92 was added to this sum, and the result was
  the 1,435,980 written out in the Manuscript, <i>i.e.</i>, a day IV Ahau
  13 Zip (5 Muluc). Now this number is the one sought; it is 5523 × 260 =
  1841 × 780 = 3945 × 364, and hence must also be equal to 263 × 5460,
  since the 780 and 364 are united in 5460. According to our present
  knowledge, it would seem to lie in the future, but not far from the
  present; the solar and Mars revolutions are united in it. There is but a
  single hieroglyph here, the hieroglyph of the animal which is the chief
  subject of the next section; from which it appears that the two sections
  are closely connected.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 44b&mdash;45b.</b></p>

  <p>This section supplements the pictures and hieroglyphs belonging to the
  series just examined. Therefore it likewise extends over 78 days and
  divides them as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>These five days are plainly intended to be the days III Lamat, IX
  Manik, II Cimi, VIII Chicchan, III Cimi.</p>

  <p>With regard to the real purport of this section, it is my opinion that
  it has reference to the time of the shortest day and also to the four
  winds and that this section therefore forms, in a measure, a contrast to
  pages 38-41, where attention was called to the rainy season, the longest
  day and the thunderstorms.</p>

  <p>We see here in the first place four of the ordinary heavenly <!-- Page
  166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>{166}</span>shields,
  with two astronomical signs each. I cannot decide, at present, whether
  these are 1st, the moon and Saturn, 2nd, Mars and Mercury, 3d, the moon
  and Mars, and 4th, Jupiter and Venus.</p>

  <p>From each of these shields hangs a figure not unlike an heraldic
  beast. It cannot be the canine lightning-beast; it has no flames, it is
  cloven-footed and with the upper lip bent upward and the lower lip curved
  downward suggesting the storm-god K, and therefore probably represents
  the four winds; this wind-beast repeated four times also occurs on Cort.
  2.</p>

  <p>Six hieroglyphs belong to each picture. Those in the first place are
  pierced ears and refer therefore to the ritual bloodletting, which may
  have been performed at this season. In Tro. 5*b we also find the pierced
  ear; a pierced <i>tongue</i> (Tro. 17*b), however, does not occur in the
  Dresdensis. The second place always contains the sign of the beast like
  the one instance on page 43.</p>

  <p>The third place seems to be devoted to the four cardinal points,
  <i>i.e.</i>, to the four winds. First we see Akbal-Kin, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  transition from night to day, the east. The north-god, C, is here in the
  second group; in the third we see Kin and beside it in the fourth place
  Akbal, both enveloped by clouds denoting the transition from day to
  night, the west. The fourth group, it is true, has the year-sign here,
  but with the compound Kin-Cauac prefixed, and Cauac always belongs to the
  south. I believe I have found a distinct reference to the season of the
  year in two other places. The fourth hieroglyph of the second group and
  the sixth of the fourth both have the familiar prefix suggesting K, the
  storm-god. The first of the two contains the month Mol (December
  3d-22nd); the second might very well be the month Yax (January
  12th-31st). This is quite in keeping with the distances 19 + 21 = 40 set
  down below.</p>

  <p>In my "Tagegöttern der Mayas" (Globus LXXIII, 10) and above in my
  discussion of the great Tonalamatl under pages 4a-10a, I have assigned
  the day Chuen to C, and Muluc to K, <i>i.e.</i>, the first to the dark
  north and the latter to the wind, which are both under consideration
  here. In fact, we find the Chuen sign in the fifth place of the fourth
  group with the same prefix <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page167"></a>{167}</span>that C has in the second group. The Muluc
  sign, however, seems to occur three times:&mdash;1st, group 1, sign 6,
  where it may be joined to the month Mol belonging here; 2nd, group 3,
  sign 5, joined to the Akbal, which also belongs here; 3d, group 4, sign
  4, with a usual prefix. In the second group it may be included in the
  very similar month sign of Mol. Four hieroglyphs remain:&mdash;1st, Akbal
  in group 1, sign 5, hence probably denoting the darker time of the year
  in general; 2nd, A in 2, sign 5; 3d, E in 2, sign 6; <i>i.e.</i>,
  probably referring to the death of the grain (I do not know to what
  extent this expression may be used in relation to the Maya country); 4th,
  Kan-Imix in 3, sign 6, perhaps expressing the hope of new harvests.</p>

  <p>This finishes the middle sections of the pages of the first part of
  the Manuscript, and we must now turn back again to page 29 in order to
  examine the lower sections.</p>

  <p>Here is a Tonalamatl of four quarters, 4 × 65.</p>

  <p>In the Manuscript 16 is again erroneously set down for 17 and the III
  following it is omitted. The initial day is exactly the same III Ix, as
  in section 29b above it, to which in other respects the passage now under
  consideration shows a great likeness, since the four familiar animals
  occur here as well as there. But in spite of beginning in the same way
  the days here are different ones, being the four regents of the year, as
  on page 9b.</p>

  <p>The four parts are grouped together by the sign, which always occupies
  the first place in each part; I have denoted this sign by <i>f</i>, and I
  think it must have a very general significance, since from pages 29c to
  40c it always begins the groups. The connection between the four parts is
  further shown by the four cardinal points in the second place:&mdash;the
  north in the first group, the west in the second, the south in the third
  and the east in the fourth. In the third place these cardinal points are
  again indicated by their usual abbreviations; the east is erroneously
  <!-- Page 168 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page168"></a>{168}</span>set down in the second group. These
  abbreviations are here invariably joined to the head of C as the
  representative of the north, the first of the cardinal points occurring
  in this passage; the others revolve about the north pole.</p>

  <p>As B's sign always occurs in the fourth place, there is nothing
  further to be said concerning the hieroglyphs. We now come to the
  pictures<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. B is rowing a boat, as we have already seen him several times (36b,
  40a, <i>c</i>, and 43c). To the left of his head there is a bird's head
  and in the left, bottom, corner, a pot in which apparently a soup of fowl
  is cooking, emitting bubbles. The Cib sign on the pot refers to the
  cooking or bubbling.</p>

  <p>2. B, with his head surrounded by the familiar stars, is seated in
  water, in which are represented the iguana over a Kan sign, and the
  familiar spiral probably denoting a serpent. He is painted black (perhaps
  corresponding to the west?) and holds in his hand an implement not yet
  determined. Perhaps it may be intended for a tree, <i>past</i> which the
  water is flowing.</p>

  <p>3. The god is seated, holding in one hand the spiral with a Kin sign
  over it and a Yax on top of that, and in the other hand something which
  looks like a bird's feather or a fish's fin. Above him is a fish with a
  Kan sign, as on page 27, where the fish and Kan are also combined.</p>

  <p>4. Holding a hunting-spear, he is sitting on an animal slain in the
  chase, as on page 45c.</p>

  <p>Finally, I have remarked that pages 42c-45c, the last part of the
  first division of the Manuscript, look like an enlargement or amendment
  of the section just considered.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 30c&mdash;33c.</b></p>

  <p>To begin with, the day signs are set down in the following order<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Here then, as is frequently the case in this Manuscript, all the
  twenty days are specified. But in order to obtain equal periods of time,
  the left column should first be read from top to bottom and the following
  ones should be treated in the same way. Then each succeeding day is 17
  days distant from the preceding, but in reality the interval is 117 days,
  since the same week-day is always implied. The hieroglyphs seem to
  indicate that these 117 days are divided into three distinct parts, 52,
  39 and 26.</p>

  <p>117 days, however, are equal to 9 × 13 and hence in what follows we
  find a black 13 set down 9 times as the interval between the days, and a
  red XI being the number of the week-day an equal number of times. Now,
  since the whole series extends over 20 such sections of 117 days, the
  duration of this calendar is 2340 days or 9 Tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>Consequently we find nine pictures of the same god B. In five of them
  (in Groups 1-4 and 9) he is sitting before or on a sacrificial tree or
  tree of life; cf. 30b. It is probably not accidental that in these five
  cases the hieroglyphs refer to the cardinal points. In the eighth group
  the god is surrounded by the suggestion of one or more trees; he is
  sitting in water as if in a forest; or in a cave bordered by trees? In
  the remaining groups, 5, 6 and 7 he is seated on various supports, in 5
  on an object, which is not completed and which cannot, therefore, be
  explained, in 6 on astronomical figures (Mars and Venus?) and in 7 on
  agave leaves. In 1 and 3 his head is again surrounded by those dots
  suggesting stars, in 4 there seems to be a bird (quetzal?) seated upon it
  and in 2 it bears what may be the Kin sign. In 1 and 5 he has the pouch
  for incense in his hand, while in 3 alone he wears the gala mantle and is
  painted black, just as he appears in connection with the same hieroglyphs
  on page 29c. He carries a hatchet in repose in 2, 6 and 9, and raised for
  a blow in 1 and 7. In 7 he also holds the Imix sign.</p>

  <p>The hieroglyphs form nine groups of four signs each. The first
  hieroglyph, as is always the case in this part of the Manuscript, is the
  sign which I have denoted by <i>f</i>, and the second is always B's
  hieroglyph. The cardinal points are everywhere specified by two signs
  each; in places 3 and 4 of group 1, the <!-- Page 170 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page170"></a>{170}</span>west comes first and
  beside it is the sign for the east, erroneously used for that of the west
  (a like error occurred in the preceding Tonalamatl); in group 2 there are
  two signs for the north; in group 3 that for the east with the sign for
  the west beside it erroneously given for the east, and in group 4 two
  signs for the south. In groups 5, 6 and 7 we find in the 4th place the
  head of C, and the same sign in group 7 in the 3d place, where it is
  joined to another head, which may be that of a woman. The 3d sign of
  group 5 is incomplete and cannot be determined. The 3d sign of group 6
  displays a repetition of the astronomical signs represented below. There
  still remain the 3d and 4th signs of groups 8 and 9. Of these the 3d in
  group 8 is <i>w</i>, which is as yet unexplained. The 4th might be
  interpreted either as Oc (day 7) or as Xul (end). Its prefix is a Yax
  sign. Finally, in group 9 the 3d sign is Manik (day 4), the 4th the
  elongated head <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik superfix, which Seler assigns to
  Men (day 12).</p>

  <p>The beginning of this Tonalamatl is indicated by a large red dot on

  31b-35b, inasmuch as its arrangement is an unusual one. I will here, as I
  did above, give it the form in which it would present itself if it were
  set down in the usual order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In this passage as in the earlier one, instead of employing the above
  concise order, a preference has been shown throughout for carrying out
  the whole series in such a manner that the week days are set down each
  time and not merely in the left column. It, therefore, has the following
  form in the Manuscript<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>I have arranged the whole series in four parallel periods of 65 days
  each, for the 65 appears throughout the computation, although the entire
  Tonalamatl is written out in <i>one</i> continuous line. On the right of
  page 35 the scribe seems to have wished to erase an entirely incongruous
  4, and in writing the last 15, on page 39, he began to use the red paint
  prematurely, so that the top one of the three lines is red.</p>

  <p>Attention should also be called to the fact that the second of my
  vertical columns contains the year-regents, the others only the days
  following immediately after them, while 12 month days do not occur at
  all. Also the intervening periods 9 + 11 (= 20), 20, 10, 15 doubtless
  reveal some design.</p>

  <p>In order to avoid repetition, I think it proper to mention first, that
  in the twenty groups of four hieroglyphs each, the sign <i>f</i> always
  stands in the first place, but the hieroglyph of B, who is represented 20
  times, usually appears in the second place, in the first and second
  groups in the third place, and in the 18th and 19th his sign does not
  appear at all. I will discuss the remaining hieroglyphs in their place in
  each of the 20 groups.</p>

  <p>1. B is sitting in a house and holding the Kan sign in his hand.</p>

  <p>The second hieroglyph is apparently meant for the Ahau sign (referring
  to the 17th day), which usually does not belong to B. This hieroglyph,
  which certainly bears a resemblance to Ahau and with which we have become
  very familiar in the inscriptions, occurs again in this Manuscript on
  pages 46b, c, 50b, 54b, 65a and 66a. The fourth sign is a combination of
  Cauac and Manik.</p>

  <p>2. B is seated on what may be a tree, below him is the cross <i>b</i>,
  and he holds the hatchet in his left hand.</p>

  <p>The second sign with an emphasized 6 as a prefix (cf. the same sign
  with the 6 on page 48, bottom, left, below the gods), has the usual
  Ben-Ik superfix, perhaps to denote that a lunar month has now elapsed,
  for this passage extends from the 20th to the 40th day of the Tonalamatl.
  The rest of the hieroglyph is unintelligible. In the 4th place we see a
  vessel with Imix, probably denoting pulque.</p>

  <p>3. B is sitting in water, the hatchet raised in his right hand and his
  face turned upward. <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page172"></a>{172}</span></p>

  <p>The 3d hieroglyph is again Imix and the 4th a compound of Ik and
  Muluc:&mdash;wind and clouds.</p>

  <p>4. B is seated on a reproduction of his own head or D's, beating a
  drum with his hand.</p>

  <p>The 3d hieroglyph denotes the serpent-god H with the number 3 as a
  prefix. The 4th hieroglyph is a Chuen with the sign for the south
  prefixed,&mdash;at any rate the upper part of that sign.</p>

  <p>5. B is standing in the pouring rain and looking backward.</p>

  <p>The 3d sign here is a Caban apparently in a vessel. Following this in
  4 is the hieroglyph which I have proposed to interpret as the sign for
  <i>beginning</i> (Globus, Vol. LXVI, page 79). This sign occurs again in
  groups 7, 12, 15, 17 and 19, and must therefore be connected with the
  principal idea embodied in this Tonalamatl.</p>

  <p>6. B with folded arms is sitting in a house.</p>

  <p>Aside from the usual leaflike prefix, the third sign is composed of
  two parts. The upper part looks like a plaited mat and suggests that the
  word for the first month of the year (Pop) is expressed by mat. The lower
  part is the sign, which occurs frequently especially on pages 25-28, and
  which very much resembles the familiar sign for a year of 360 days. We
  shall meet it again in the continuation of this Tonalamatl on pages 36
  and 38. The three passages refer to the 74th, 139th, and 204th days of
  the Tonalamatl, and hence are 65 days apart.</p>

  <p>The 4th sign is the cross <i>b</i>, with possibly the sign of the east
  as a prefix.</p>

  <p>7. B is seated on the cross <i>b</i>, which is here undoubtedly meant
  for an astronomical sign. He holds a Kan sign in his hand and there is an
  Ahau sign on his back.</p>

  <p>The naked crouching personage, pointing upward, should have especial
  mention here. The same figure recurs above as a prefix to the 4th
  hieroglyph. We have already seen it in the 39th hieroglyph on page 24,
  and shall meet it with especial frequency in the second part of the
  Manuscript. It is placed sometimes, as in this case, <i>before</i> a
  sign, sometimes <i>after</i> a sign and again two of these figures are
  placed back to back as on page 22c, and one of them is even placed upside
  down before another sign, where it seemed to me to be a sign for Mercury
  ("Zur Entzifferung <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page173"></a>{173}</span>VII," p. 11). This figure is represented
  independently only on the right of page 58. In the passage under present
  consideration this personage appears again on page 38. The two figures
  are connected one with the 85th and the other with the 215th day, and
  are, therefore, divided by exactly half a Tonalamatl or 130 days. Here we
  find it as a prefix of the supposed sign for <i>beginning</i> of which
  mention was made in discussing the 5th group. The 3d sign is the same
  astronomical one, which we saw below under B. It might refer to the Moan
  and to the change of the year, and thus indicate that a Mercury
  revolution was coincident here with the beginning of the solar year.</p>

  <p>8. B is walking in the rain, both arms are stretched upward, and the
  pouch hangs from his neck. At the left top there is a black spot
  suggesting those which usually occur beside the sun and moon.</p>

  <p>The 3rd sign is Manik, with a prefix. The 4th is an indistinct head,
  which may be C's, with an Imix sign as a prefix.</p>

  <p>9. B is walking with the pouch hanging from his neck, and the hatchet
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>The 3d sign, which is unusual, is very obscure, but suggests the fish
  on page 44c or that on page 36b. The 4th sign with the prefix of the
  north is very indistinct.</p>

  <p>10. B is standing in <i>water</i>, his face turned upward while water
  is pouring from a cloud. The third sign is very complex. The top, left,
  suggests a serpent, the right a hand, the bottom, left, a Chuen and the
  element at the bottom, right, may be intended for a bird's head. Exactly
  the same sign, with the 4th part merely indicated, occurs 65 days later
  on page 38. The 4th sign is the familiar compound Kin-Akbal.</p>

  <p>11. B is sitting in a tent, on the roof of which there is a vessel
  containing food of some kind.</p>

  <p>The third sign, which is very complex, is indistinct. The 4th sign
  likewise consists of four parts, the left, bottom, part is probably the
  vessel, above it is a spiral (which usually means serpent or time). The
  right, bottom, is again the sign resembling the year-sign which was
  spoken of in discussing group 6. The component at the right, top, is
  indistinct.</p>

  <p>12. B is sitting here on no less than four astronomical signs, <!--
  Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>{174}</span>he
  has the hatchet in his hand and the design on his back may be a shield or
  the elaborately ornamented sun-glyph Kin.</p>

  <p>The third sign (denoting <i>beginning</i>?) has already been discussed
  in connection with group 7, which is 65 days earlier. The fourth is the
  sign of the year of 360 days or the month Pax with the Ben-Ik as a
  prefix. These signs are here suggestive of the beginning and end of the
  year.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Above</i> B are astronomical signs (Jupiter and Mercury?) and
  also the sun and moon. The rain is pouring down upon the god, and a fish
  is placed beside him. He seems to have the same chisel in his hand which
  we saw him using on page 41b in connection with the beginning of the
  year. This again would correspond to the date indicated in the preceding
  picture. The shield (?) also is the same here as in the preceding
  group.</p>

  <p>The third sign ought to represent the fish; the drawing seems to have
  been unsuccessful and the sign looks more like a bird and also resembles
  the third sign in the ninth group on page 36. The fourth sign is a
  Kin-Akbal.</p>

  <p>14. B is seated on the elongated head <i>q</i>, which has an ordinary
  prefix. He is pointing upward with his right hand and the left looks as
  if opened to receive something.</p>

  <p>The third hieroglyph contains a <i>q</i> like the one under the god,
  the fourth is an indistinct head (C's?) with an unintelligible
  prefix.</p>

  <p>15. B is standing in water while rain is again pouring down upon him.
  He holds the hatchet raised in his left hand, while the fingers of the
  right are extended upward in an unusual manner. This is repeated in the
  third hieroglyph.</p>

  <p>The third hieroglyph, however, is the same as the third in the tenth
  group 65 days earlier, only here the hand is more distinct, while the
  element below it is vague. The fourth sign is again the one denoting
  beginning. Compare the fifth group (130 days earlier).</p>

  <p>16. B with arms folded is sitting in a house with the Cauac sign
  below.</p>

  <p>The third and fourth hieroglyphs contain the sign resembling that for
  the year, which was mentioned in discussing the sixth group (130 days
  earlier). In the third a Kin is prefixed to this <!-- Page 175 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>{175}</span>sign, while the
  superfix of the fourth is what I take to be a mat, which also occurred in
  the sixth group. The prefix is a figure suggesting the serpent-deity,
  which we have already met with in the tenth and fifteenth groups.</p>

  <p>17. B, holding the hatchet, is seated on a Moan head, and the third
  sign is probably intended to represent the same Moan head, in front of
  which we find the same crouching person met with in the seventh group,
  130 days earlier.</p>

  <p>The fourth hieroglyph is again the sign for beginning, which we have
  already often met with, as, for example, 65 days earlier in the twelfth
  group.</p>

  <p>18. B is sitting in the pouring rain under astronomical signs (Mars
  and Mercury?) to which those of the sun and moon are added. The god's
  face is upturned and he holds the hatchet in his hand.</p>

  <p>The third hieroglyph may be the vulture head, to which a part of the
  unintelligible second hieroglyph may also refer. This second sign stands
  in the place of B's hieroglyph, which is wanting here.</p>

  <p>The fourth sign contains the enigmatical numeral 8, which we found on
  pages 36b and 37b, and has the Imix sign as a prefix, as in the first of
  these two passages. The same compound appears on pages 67a-68a.</p>

  <p>19. B is seated here on his own head, as in the fourth group he is
  sitting on D's. His hands are empty.</p>

  <p>The second sign is again the vulture head instead of B's hieroglyph.
  The third is probably the head of the lightning beast, and the fourth is
  again the sign supposed to denote beginning.</p>

  <p>20. B is sitting in water and holding in his hands a vessel with a Kan
  sign upon it.</p>

  <p>The water (with Imix prefixed) is denoted by the third sign, while the
  fourth represents a head (with what is probably a hand pointing to the
  right above it), which I should prefer to consider the grain-deity E.</p>

  <p>In conclusion I would call attention to the remarkable fact that every
  four pictures, which are separated from each other <!-- Page 176 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>by four of the other
  pictures, <i>i.e.</i>, after every 65 days, correspond in certain
  respects with one another, <i>viz</i><span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. Pictures 1, 6, 11 and 16. In all, and <i>only</i> in these, B is
  sitting in a house or tent, in 6 and 16 with his arms folded.</p>

  <p>2. Pictures 2, 7, 12 and 17. In the first three the god is seated on
  astronomical signs and in the fourth on the Moan head, which I think
  refers to the Pleiades.</p>

  <p>3. Pictures 3, 8, 13 and 18. Here in the last two B is sitting
  <i>beneath</i> astronomical signs. In all four pictures water, clouds and
  rain are represented.</p>

  <p>4. Pictures 4, 9, 14 and 19. In the first and fourth the god is seated
  on D's head and on his own, and in the third on the elongated head
  <i>q</i>.</p>

  <p>5. Pictures 5, 10, 15 and 20. Like the third of these five classes,
  these pictures are likewise distinguished by water, clouds and rain.</p>

  <p>Now the first set of pictures is between the week days XIII and IX,
  the second between IX and VII, the third between VII and I, the fourth
  between I and XI, the fifth between XI and XIII, while the month days are
  quite different. Hence the conjecture is but natural that the pictures
  and week days bear some relation to one another, though that relation is
  still shrouded in obscurity.</p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl of the most ordinary kind, in which an
  unsuccessful attempt has been made to divide the subdivisions into equal
  parts.</p>

  <p>In the groups of four hieroglyphs each, which belong to each of the
  six parts, the sign <i>f</i> always occupies the first place, and B the
  third. Let us now examine the six parts separately.</p>

  <p>1. B is sitting in a boat and rowing (as on the top of the same page).
  Around his head there is again the suggestion of what may denote the
  starry sky, and in this picture his nose-peg is unusually large. <!--
  Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span></p>

  <p>The second sign is an Imix, but it might also denote the thirteenth
  month Mac and therefore the Tonalamatl (13 × 20). The fourth sign is a
  fish forming a connecting link between the water represented below and
  the rest of the group.</p>

  <p>2. B is seated on the Caban sign and his arms are apparently resting
  on an altar standing in front of him, on which fire is burning, indicated
  by the Ik sign, while the moon is placed below the altar.</p>

  <p>The Caban sign below is repeated in the second hieroglyph, combined
  here as usual with a sign which may be Muluc.</p>

  <p>The fourth sign is a head. I think the scribe meant to set down an 8
  before it, but as there was not sufficient space for the heavy line
  <i>after</i> the three small circles, he indicated it by a black dot
  <i>below</i> the circles. Now, if we call the head D's, which of course
  cannot be asserted positively, this would be day VIII Ahau, and this, in
  fact, is twenty days from the beginning day I Ahau, as it is meant to be
  in this passage. There is no representation of food; can this have been a
  fast day?</p>

  <p>3. B is seated on four astronomical signs. He wears the gala mantle
  and holds a serpent in his hand.</p>

  <p>The second sign is <i>b</i>, and at the same time one of the
  astronomical signs. The fourth is the iguana prepared as food,
  recognizable by the spines on its back, as on page 25b. It is drawn in
  precisely the same curious fashion in Cort. 8 and 12c; hence it is
  represented in the picture by the serpent.</p>

  <p>4. B is falling down from above headfirst. I believe that the numerous
  footprints below him are only intended to represent swift motion. The
  descent from above may only be intended here to bring the god into closer
  relationship with the head of the bird of prey in the fourth sign. That
  this head is again as usual joined to Kan, may refer merely to the fact
  that it was the Maya custom to eat bread with animal food. Compare page
  27b. The second sign might be the abbreviation for the south.</p>

  <p>5. B is seated on a mat with his hand extended as if to receive
  something. He is wet with water.</p>

  <p>The second sign contains the mat, with what may be the <!-- Page 178
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>sign below it,
  and the leaf-shaped prefix probably denoting the plant from which the mat
  is plaited. The very same combination is given on page 35c and a similar
  one on 38c. The fourth sign has the prefix of the west followed by two
  Kans, as if on this day (V Akbal) it had been the custom to eat tortillas
  without meat.</p>

  <p>6. B is standing holding the hatchet. The fourth sign must denote
  venison, the fourth article of animal food. The second seems to represent
  the day Eb, with which the remaining 52 days begin, and if the prefixed 9
  indicates nothing more than that the ninth day of the month is here
  meant, it is further evidence that the "Dresdensis" began the days with
  Kan and not with Imix.</p>

  <p>In the discussion of this Tonalamatl I have omitted the mention of a
  very peculiar feature, which as yet does not admit of explanation. I
  refer to the numbers below the pictures. With the first picture we find 6
  + 20, with the second 20, with the third 19 + 20, with the fourth 6 + 20,
  with the fifth 19 + 20, and with the sixth 6 + 20, <i>i.e.</i>, with the
  exception of the second, 26 or 39, two multiples of 13. Now the question
  arises, should not one of these multiples have been set down with the
  second picture? There was no space left for a prefixed 19. Therefore the
  idea suggests itself that what we took to be an altar with the sign Ik
  above it, is intended for nothing else than this 19, and Ik is the 19th
  day, if we count from Kan as the starting-point.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 42c&mdash;45c.</b></p>

  <p>This is a Tonalamatl consisting of 4 × 65 days. If written out in the
  usual way it would run as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

  <p>Since, however, the subdivisions are divided and the individual month
  days also are given for all the parts of the whole Tonalamatl, the
  representation follows the order which we have already found on pages
  31b-35b and 33c-39c. In this place, as in the two former ones, I will
  reproduce in four lines what is set down in the Manuscript in one single
  line extending over all four pages. <!-- Page 179 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span></p>

<table class="mc">

</table>

  <p>Thus the days Chicchan, Lamat, Oc, Ben, Men, Ezanab, Ahau, and Akbal
  are repeated here twice, and the others occur but once. The 4 (17 + 48)
  strongly recalls the 4 (19 + 46) on pages 31b-35b. The repetition of six
  times eight days in each quarter of the Tonalamatl is closely connected
  with the fact that there are six Chuen signs on each page, two of which,
  however, are omitted on page 44. From this it follows, as we have already
  found on pages 25-28, that Chuen really denotes 8 days and that the count
  of the days in the "Dresdensis" begins with Kan. But the numbers 12, 15,
  16 and 17 are entirely unexplained. They show no recognizable order and
  always stand near the bundle of Chuen signs. They recall the numbers on
  pages 25-28, which are equally irregular and unintelligible, and upon
  which, it is probable, light will break at the same time as it does upon
  these now under consideration.</p>

  <p>We come now to the purport of this passage, which seems to be a
  further amplification of the contents of pages 29c-30c. The meaning is
  simply as follows:&mdash;every 65 days the god B discards a cardinal
  point and the deity presiding over it and installs another.</p>

  <p>From this point of view let us now examine the four pictures.</p>

  <p>1. Page 42. B is represented here as a warrior with the front of his
  body painted red. He is aiming a blow with his hatchet at a person sunk
  down before him, who, from the ornament above his head, seems to be the
  grain-deity E, the ruler of Kan and of the east, although the contents of
  this passage really demand a deity of the south, a ruler of Cauac. In a
  very similar way on page 27, E occurs with the completed Cauac years,
  instead of with the Kan years just beginning. Behind B's head is the sign
  of the discarded cardinal point, the south, while below it is a vessel
  with food, clearly a piece of venison with Kan. <!-- Page 180 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span></p>

  <p>2. Page 43 deals not with the removal of the old cardinal point, but
  with the introduction of the new one. Here B is rowing in a boat, as in
  other passages (29c), and Muluc, the north, has certainly a close
  relation to water. We see here two kinds of food, while none is
  represented on page 45. The same bird's head, which we find at the bottom
  of the corresponding page 28, is placed in front of the canoe, and on 29c
  it is combined with the representation of rowing a boat. On the left is
  the picture of a vessel with Kan and the iguana. There is something
  resembling a net between the boat and the bird.</p>

  <p>3. Page 44 likewise refers to the introduction of the new cardinal
  point, west, which is represented on page 26 by the tiger Ix. The two
  hieroglyphs in the middle of this passage must surely refer to an animal;
  the lower is the skeleton of an animal, which we so often find as the
  sign of the lightning-dog, but also as that of the month Kankin, and the
  upper I take to be a rather vague picture of the day Oc, which certainly
  denotes the dog. Below these two signs the fish is represented as the
  fourth species of animal food.</p>

  <p>The picture belonging to these hieroglyphs is very remarkable. B
  stands opposite a seated personage wearing an animal's snout, which
  somewhat resembles that of the wind-beast on pages 44b and 45b and also
  the nose of the storm-god K, who occurs on the corresponding pages 25 and
  26 both with the coming and the departing Ix years, as he does here with
  the coming years. In the picture before us, the two personages seem to be
  throwing something resembling a rope at each other, as if these ropes
  were to be tied together. Is this meant to suggest the casting of lots by
  means of the knotting of cords, as it is represented on page 2? Or of
  hunting with snares?</p>

  <p>Page 45 refers to the displacement of the Ix period by the Cauac
  period, <i>i.e.</i>, of the west by the south. The end of the former is
  represented here. The lightning-beast, which occurred in the preceding
  period, here lies on his back and B sits astride his body brandishing in
  each hand a burning torch as an appropriate symbol of the south. On pages
  29a and 30c we already saw the god riding on the lightning-dog.</p>

  <p>Finally the six interesting hieroglyphs set down in a vertical <!--
  Page 181 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>row
  on the left of each of the four pages are still to be examined. I will
  give here in the following table what I think is a correct interpretation
  of them<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>If that which is actually set down in the Manuscript be compared with
  this, it will be seen that in 11 of the 24 places the Manuscript
  corresponds to my hypothesis:&mdash;1, 7 and 19 are the familiar signs
  for the three cardinal points, 8 and 20 are the sign Xul = end, which I
  have already frequently mentioned, 9 and 21 are the sign for B, 11 is
  Muluc, 23 is Cauac, where the scribe has added to the correct Kin-Cauac
  the sign for the year, as if the Cauac <i>years</i> were treated of here
  as on pages 26 and 27. Finally the two agree in 12 and 18, where the
  Manuscript has the compound Kan-Imix to denote beginning, <i>i.e.</i>,
  the two days beginning the series of twenty days, one of them according
  to this Manuscript, and the other according to the method resembling that
  used by the Aztecs.</p>

  <p>The other cases have the correct signs, but set down in the wrong
  place, thus B is changed from 3 to 2, from 15 to 16, the north from 13 to
  14, the Xul from 2 to 3, 14 to 15, the E (Kan) from 5 to 4 and 6 and
  Cauac from 4 to 5, <i>i.e.</i>, pushed along every time to the next
  place. This is all in favor of my theory. As one series began at the top,
  the scribe incorrectly placed the sign for beginning in the thirteenth
  place.</p>

  <p>Strange to say in the tenth place we have the very general sign
  <i>a</i> in place of Kan. In the 4th, 17th and 22nd, and probably also in
  the half destroyed 6th sign, the scribe thoughtlessly put down a sign for
  E, which is proper only with Kan and should come after 5 or 10. Finally
  in the 24th place he put a sign for A, as if it were the intention that
  this passage should end exactly like its parallel on page 28. For, as a
  matter of fact, the two principal sections of the first part of the
  Dresdensis do end in a very similar way.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">PART II.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 46&mdash;74.</b></p>

  <p>The first glance at the form and contents of the second part of the
  Manuscript shows that it is very different from the first. The pages are
  no longer divided into the usual three parts and there are fewer
  pictures. The Tonalamatls, which form the principal contents of the first
  part, disappear wholly, and with them both the vertical columns of
  day-signs and the horizontal lines of numerals alternating between red
  and black. On the other hand, the large number series as well as the high
  numbers significantly increase and we note the appearance of the large
  vertical columns of hieroglyphs, which were impossible in the triple
  division of the earlier pages. We also find a large number of hieroglyphs
  which did not occur in the first part. The contents are essentially
  astronomical.</p>

  <p>And yet the two parts are so closely connected with one another that
  the idea of two independent Manuscripts must be dismissed. Especially the
  front side of the second part as far as page 60 is nothing more than an
  amplification of page 24. The contents of pages 61-74 are of a more
  independent nature, but special attention should be called to the
  relation of 31a-32a to 62-63.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 46&mdash;50.</b></p>

  <p>The entire contents of these pages must be represented as a unit, for
  what is in the main true of page 24 is also true of these pages, namely
  that they treat exclusively of the period of 2920 days, in which five
  Venus years of 584 days each are brought into accord with eight solar or
  terrestrial years of 365 days each. Each page is a direct continuation of
  the preceding one. Each period of 2920 days is taken 13 times, the result
  being 37,960 days, which are equal to 146 Tonalamatls.</p>

  <p>I will give here first a reproduction, as it were, of the left <!--
  Page 183 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>{183}</span>side
  of the five pages, omitting for greater clearness a few indifferent
  matters, which are intended only to fill the blank spaces, viz<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The twenty hands pointing to the right, with a knife placed over
  them, in the middle of the pages, which mean nothing more than that these
  parts of the Venus year are to be read from left to right.</p>

  <p>2. The Venus hieroglyph three lines below, repeated twenty times with
  the sign of the knife, to denote the <i>division</i> of the Venus
  revolution.</p>

  <p>3. The <i>Akbal</i> sign occurring further down, four times on each
  page, except on pages 46 and 47. This is the last of the day-signs, again
  counting forward from the day Kan, and means only that henceforth the
  <i>close</i> of the four periods of the Venus year is indicated below, as
  the beginning is indicated above.</p>

  <p>4. The sixteen Venus signs also occurring below, except on page 48.
  This sign likewise occurs in a very similar form on Altar R of Copan.</p>

  <p>With these omissions, the left side of these pages presents the
  following appearance<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Let us first examine the numbers which are regularly repeated <!--
  Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>in
  the lowest line:&mdash;236, 90, 250, and 8, and we shall find that the
  584 days of the apparent Venus revolution are divided into these four
  periods.</p>

  <p>The number 236 denotes the time of the western elongation, when Venus
  is the morning star, 90 the time of the invisibility of the planet,
  during its superior conjunction, 250 that of its eastern elongation, when
  Venus is the evening star, and 8 the time of its invisibility during
  inferior conjunction. The disproportion between 236 and 250 is somewhat
  striking. These periods which need not of course be exactly equal are
  usually computed at 243 days. The short period of eight days is only
  calculated for very sharp eyes; we actually find in the Anales del Museo
  Nacional de Mexico II, 341 (Mex. 1882), that the Aztecs calculated only
  eight days for the invisibility of Venus, and this period is also
  mentioned in the Anales de Quauhtitlan. The repetition of the cardinal
  points in the 15th and 20th lines of the extract given above refer to
  these periods; in the upper line to their beginning and in the lower to
  their close. Hence in the lower line the cardinal points must advance one
  place and the gods belonging to them in the 16th and 19th lines must
  follow the same course.</p>

  <p>The numbers in the 17th line indicate to which day of the period of
  2920 days the position has advanced.</p>

  <p>But now we see that the indication of days in the lines 1-13, the
  indication of months in lines 14, 18 and 21, and the numbers in line 17
  are separated from those directly to the right of them by a number of
  days equal to the numbers given in the lowest line.</p>

  <p>From this it follows that each day of the thirteen top lines is joined
  to each of the month dates placed just below them, forming a complete
  calendar date. Therefore from the III Cib on the left upper corner of
  page 46 a III Cib 4 Yaxkin, a III Cib 8 Zac, a III Cib 19 Kayab must be
  formed.</p>

  <p>All the 4 × 13 × 5 = 260 day indications combined with three month
  indications each, show therefore that this whole passage is a huge
  abbreviation for 780 calendar dates and that the whole refers to 3 ×
  37,960 days = 113,880 days. But 37,960 <!-- Page 186 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span>which we already found
  on page 24, is equal to 146 × 260, 104 × 365, 65 × 584, 13 × 2920. I am
  inclined to think that I also found 113,880 on page 24.</p>

  <p>But the 3 × 37,960 = 113,880 days do not form the entire period
  treated of here. For the three periods begin and end with the days<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>I Ahau 13 Mac (10 Muluc),</td></tr>
<tr><td>I Ahau 18 Kayab (3 Kan),</td></tr>
<tr><td>I Ahau 3 Xul (4 Cauac).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Hence these three dates, the second of which was found on page 24,
  prove that the three periods of 37,960 are not consecutive, but that
  there is an interval between them. Now between the first and second of
  the three dates the interval is 19 years + 85 days = 7020 days, and
  between the second and third, the interval is 26 years + 130 days = 9620
  days. If these two periods be added to the 113,880 days, the sum is the
  whole period treated of here, viz:&mdash; 130,520 = 502 × 260 days.</p>

  <p>But a truly surprising result is obtained, if, as must often be the
  case with series, we begin not with the upper of the three dates, but
  with the lower.</p>

  <p>From I Ahau 3 Xul (4 Cauac) to I Ahau 18 Kayab (3 Kan) there is a
  lapse of 9360 days or 12 apparent Mars years of 780 days, such as we
  shall find as the principal subject of page 59. 9360, however, equals 25
  × 365 + 235 days. We shall meet with this 235 again as a difference on
  page 63.</p>

  <p>But from I Ahau 18 Kayab (3 Kan) to I Ahau 13 Mac (10 Muluc) there are
  11,960 days, <i>i.e.</i>, the 104 Mercury years, which we found on page
  24, and which we shall find again as the principal period on pages 51-58.
  But this is equal to 32 years + 280 or 33 years <span class="nw">-</span>
  85 days. Now if 113,880, 9360, 11,960 are added together, we have for the
  entire period under discussion here, 135,200 days, and this is equal to 2
  × 260 × 260 days. Thus the Mayas seem actually to have had an idea of a
  second power.</p>

  <p>Finally I would call attention to a singular double connection between
  the numbers occurring here<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>37,960 - 11,960 = 26,000 = 100 Tonalamatls,</td></tr>
<tr><td>11,960 - 9,360 = 2600 = 10 Tonalamatls.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>{187}</span></p>

  <p>But if we subtract 2 × 11,960 = 23,920 from 37,960, the remainder is
  14,040, <i>i.e.</i>, an extraordinary number which often occurs and is
  equal to 54 × 260, 39 × 360 and 18 × 780.</p>

  <p>In short, a Mars and a Mercury-lunar period are inserted in the two
  spaces between the three solar-Venus periods.</p>

  <p>Now, let us try to gain a clearer understanding of this subject by
  approaching from another side.</p>

  <p>As we have seen, the beginning of the middle one of the three equal
  periods of 37,960 days, is the date I Ahau 18 Kayab (3 Kan). Now,
  however, page 24 furnished us with a day number for this date, 1,364,360,
  and from this the beginnings of the other two periods may be computed in
  the following way<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr025">I Ahau <span class="hid">0</span>3 Xul &nbsp; &nbsp;(4 Cauac) </td><td class="pl0">= 1,317,040,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">I Ahau 18 Kayab &nbsp; (3 Kan) </td><td class="pl0">= 1,364,360,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">I Ahau 13 Mac (10 Muluc) </td><td class="pl0">= 1,414,280.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Between the first number and the second there are 47,320 days =
  2<sup>3</sup> × 5 × 7 × 13<sup>2</sup>, and between the second and third
  49,920 days = 2<sup>8</sup> × 3 × 5 × 13 days.</p>

  <p>But, according to what has been stated above, 47,320 = 37,960 + 9360,
  and 49,920 = 37,960 + 11,960.</p>

  <p>The whole period is therefore divided as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>It begins with a Venus-solar-Tonalamatl-period followed by 12 Mars
  years, then the great period again followed by 8 × 13 = 104 Mercury
  years, and lastly, apparently about the present time, comes the third
  great period, which, as already stated, ends 135,200 days after the first
  date.</p>

  <p>The case assumes a different aspect, if we insert between the three
  dates the other two from page 24<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,317,040 = I Ahau,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,352,400 = I Ahau,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,364,360 = I Ahau,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,366,560 = IV Ahau,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,414,280 = I Ahau.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Here we have again, as examination of page 24 showed, the difference
  11,960 between the second and third numbers, while there is no longer any
  connection with the periods of 37,960 days. <!-- Page 188 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page188"></a>{188}</span></p>

  <p>Of the left halves of the pages we have now examined all except the
  twenty hieroglyphs of the gods. I shall mention them according to the
  upper place in line 16; the lower in line 19, where the hieroglyphs move
  forward only one place, is only referred to when the two signs differ.
  They offer many problems still unsolved.</p>

  <p>The first sign on page 46 is an unknown sign, which, however, is
  repeated several times on the right side of the pages; the second is
  probably an Ahau (<i>i.e.</i>, D) with a prefix suggesting the snail, the
  symbol of birth; the third is a head also occurring elsewhere, which I
  have not yet determined; the fourth is A; compare page 24, hieroglyph
  25.</p>

  <p>Page 47. The first sign is probably K; compare the third picture on
  page 7a with its hieroglyph; the second is C's hieroglyph with an Akbal
  appropriate to it; the third sign is Moan with the 13 belonging to it;
  the fourth sign is N's with a prefixed 4; the year-sign in the lower
  series is replaced by Zac, which agrees equally well; compare page 24,
  hieroglyph 21.</p>

  <p>Page 48. The first sign is Kin with the Ben-Ik superfix, perhaps
  denoting G; the second is a figure similar to the year-sign with a
  prefixed 6. This same sign in the line below has a 6, but is very
  different in other respects; the third is an Akbal with superfix and
  prefix, perhaps denoting D; the fourth is a head which might easily be
  F's; compare page 24, hieroglyph 22.</p>

  <p>Page 49. The first sign is B's; the second, A's; the 3d, K's; compare
  page 24, hieroglyph 38; the fourth is H's with a prefixed 1; compare page
  24, hieroglyphs 23 and perhaps 37.</p>

  <p>Page 50. The first sign is E's; compare page 24, hieroglyph 38; the
  second is L, the black deity; compare page 24, hieroglyph 32; the third
  is an unknown hieroglyph with a prefixed 7, which also occurs on page 5a
  and 19b; the fourth is the bat-god; compare page 24, hieroglyph 24.</p>

  <p>I find it impossible to discover any relation between these
  hieroglyphs and the periods and I have as little success with the
  hieroglyphs apparently belonging to the same cardinal point. Perhaps we
  should follow Seler here (Quetzalcoatl and Kukulcan, p. 403), who thinks
  these passages suggest constellations with which Venus is in conjunction;
  this question, owing <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>to the retrogression of the planet, raises
  increased difficulties. It is curious that the fourth of these signs on
  page 46 is like the fourteenth on page 49 (A), and perhaps the two
  following refer to the same god K; the first two are separated by 1494
  days and the latter by 1508 days.</p>

  <p>We come now to the <i>right</i> half of the pages. Interpretation is
  rendered impossible by the destruction of the top part. For we do not
  even know whether the upper hieroglyphs occupied three or four rows each,
  the latter being the case at least in part, and there may have been a
  superscription over the day signs in the left half.</p>

  <p>These upper signs are always followed by a picture, then three rows of
  hieroglyphs, then a second picture and next two rows of hieroglyphs and
  lastly a third picture.</p>

  <p>Let us first examine the pictures<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>At the top of pages 46-49 there is on each page a deity, who with his
  right arm extended is offering or receiving something. He is seated on
  astronomical signs; on page 46 B's head accompanies these signs. On pages
  46 and 48 the deity is undoubtedly the old woman with tiger claws, who
  usually pours streams of water from a jug (compare pages 39, 43 and 74).
  I cannot identify the personage on pages 47 and 49. The object in the
  deity's hand seems invariably to be a cup of foaming pulque. On page 49
  another object is placed above the cup, which I am unable to determine.
  The fifth, page 50, differs from the other four and forms the connecting
  link, as it were, between the upper row of pictures and the middle and
  lower ones. Here, too, a personage is represented sitting on astronomical
  signs and exhibiting symptoms of violent anger toward a second person
  opposite him holding the cup in his hands. Both personages are painted as
  warriors.</p>

  <p>The middle pictures on all the pages represent a warrior in a
  half-kneeling, half-crouching posture, holding spears or a shield in the
  right hand and brandishing a hatchet in the left. The shield on page 46
  is doubtless a representation of the sun-glyph; and on 47 the Venus sign
  is combined with the head ornament. The hieroglyphs of these deities
  occupy the first place in the middle line of the three lines above the
  pictures. <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>

  <p>The five lower pictures represent a creature lying on the ground,
  pierced by arrows and spears. On page 47 it is a jaguar; at any rate it
  is the same animal found on pages 29a, 30c and 45c; a very similar
  creature pierced by arrows is given in the Cod. Vat. B.; compare also the
  pictures in Seler's "Venus-periode," page 371. On the other four pages
  this creature is in human guise. On page 50 where, differing from the
  other four pages, this figure is represented lying with the head to the
  right, it is plainly shedding tears. Seler takes this figure to be E on
  page 48 and the tortoise on page 49. The varying periods of time occupied
  by the revolution of the planets is plainly conceived of as contest. But
  who is the victor in this contest? The planet with the longer or with the
  shorter period of revolution? Owing to obliteration only a small part of
  the hieroglyphs of the top section is legible.</p>

  <p>On page 46 we see the Venus sign and E's hieroglyph; on page 47 the
  sign <i>c</i>, which occurs frequently on these pages, and is probably
  always connected with Moan (the Pleiades and thus with the year). The
  numeral 1, prefixed to an obliterated sign on page 47, is still legible,
  and we find it repeated on the lower part of the same page. There is
  rather more to be seen on page 48:&mdash;first the elongated head
  <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik superfix, then the sign <i>a</i>, beside it that
  for the west with a prefix, in the line below an Ahau, next, an Akbal
  sign with the prefix of the north, and lastly a Moan sign.</p>

  <p>On page 49 we see sign <i>c</i> again occupying the first place, then
  o with Ben-Ik, and in the lower line the year sign with that for 20 or
  the moon as a superfix, and to the right of it the head with the Akbal
  eye, probably denoting D.</p>

  <p>This top part of the page is best preserved on page 50. In the third
  line from the bottom we see the Venus sign and beside it the Moan sign,
  below, a Cauac, then a Kin with the Ben-Ik superfix, then a Kan-Imix.
  Finally, in the first place in the lowest row there is a Kin sign and in
  the second place a sign resembling the year-sign, both having the same
  superfix, the next sign is again <i>c</i> and the last is a half-effaced
  sign, of which only a Muluc is distinguishable.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the middle section of these pages is <!-- Page 191
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>{191}</span>somewhat more
  definite. There are twelve hieroglyphs on each page, which I will number
  in the following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="ar"> 2</td><td class="ar"> 3</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="ar"> 6</td><td class="ar"> 7</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 8</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">9</td><td class="ar">10</td><td class="ar">11</td><td class="pr0 ar">12</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Unquestionably these 5 × 12 signs refer to a Venus year, more exactly
  to the <i>beginning</i> of it, the period of the east. The first sign,
  which is a hand pointing to the right, merely refers here, as on the left
  side, to the direction in which this is to be read; the second sign is
  always the sign for the east, and the sixth invariably that for
  Venus.</p>

  <p>Notice should be taken of the fact that the signs of the Moan and
  screech-owl or death-bird are recurrent, that of the Moan appearing on
  page 46, sign 7; 48, 3; 49, 11; 50, 11; and that of the death-bird on
  page 47, sign 3; 48, 11, 49, 3, 50, 3 and 7, <i>i.e.</i>, only in places
  3, 7 and 11, which indicates that the 12 signs are divided each time into
  three times four.</p>

  <p>It is further to be noted that the five gods, who are represented on
  page 24 by hieroglyphs 36-40, always recur in the ninth place in the
  order of the pages:&mdash;the god represented on page 24 by sign 36 is
  the 8th on page 49; the 38th on the same page is the 11th on page 46 and
  the 12th on page 50; the 39th is the 12th on page 47, and the 40th may be
  the 5th on page 49, though this is hardly possible. On page 49 the 9th
  hieroglyph seems to be the 39th on page 24 joined to the sign for the
  month Kayab.</p>

  <p>Of the twenty gods on the left side of these pages, I have already
  remarked that E, who on page 24 occupies the 38th place, and the 11th on
  page 46, also occurs as the 9th on page 48 and the 12th on page 50.</p>

  <p>It is doubtless of special significance that the sign of the first of
  the twenty deities on the left side of page 46 is repeated on the right
  as the tenth sign on all the pages (on page 47 also in the eleventh place
  where it has a prefixed 3). It seems as if this sign, which is otherwise
  quite unfamiliar, might be connected with the sun and regarded as a
  contrast to the Venus sign in the sixth place.</p>

  <p>Also the 9th deity of the left side, the 1st of page 48, <!-- Page 192
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>{192}</span>reappears in
  the 4th place on page 49; the 10th deity, the 2nd on page 48, in the 12th
  on page 49; the 15th deity, the 3d on page 49, in the 9th on page 46 and
  the 8th on page 49 (as already stated); the 18th, the 2nd on page 50, in
  the 5th on page 46.</p>

  <p>The 2nd of these deities is suggested by the 8th on page 47, perhaps
  also by the 5th on page 50; the 3d and 13th seem to be A and to recur in
  the 3d place on page 46.</p>

  <p>On the other hand C, the god who, as I believe I have proved, is
  connected with the day-sign Chuen, does not appear on the left side. Now
  the 4th sign on page 46 contains a Chuen, which in the 12th sign on page
  48 is probably combined with a Muluc, in the 12th on page 49 with Yax and
  a prefixed 6, and in the 4th sign on page 50 with C's sign, <i>i.e.</i>,
  as a rule Chuen stands in the 4th place in a line.</p>

  <p>As the gods E and K already mentioned also appear on pages 25-28 in
  connection with the change of the year, so we find the tiger on the top
  of page 26, and I believe this animal occurs again in the 7th sign on
  page 47.</p>

  <p>Of the day-signs I take the 4th on page 47 to be Kan, the 7th on page
  48 to be Caban, and the next sign, the 8th on page 48, to be Muluc. Now
  if we take into consideration the fact, that of the three periods of the
  month signs on the left side of these pages, the 18th (the middle) line
  is the most important, owing to its ending, 18 Kayab, alone, if for no
  other reason; furthermore, that in this middle period the second Venus
  year always ends with a Kan year and the third with a Muluc year, one is
  naturally led to suppose that the illegible sign 12 on page 46 is an Ix
  (for thus the first Venus year ends) and that the days Cauac and Kan
  might have been found among the obliterated day-signs on pages 49 and
  50.</p>

  <p>I shall examine the remaining signs in the order of the pages.</p>

  <p>Sign 8 on page 46 is the same compound of Yax and Kin having as a
  superfix the sign assumed by me to be the numeral 18, which occurs again
  in the lower group on page 50 and also on page 27.</p>

  <p>In the number 11 prefixed to the fifth sign on page 47, the 1 seems to
  be indistinct and may not belong here. If we correctly assume that this
  number is 10, then the sign is the same as <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>the 34th on page 24, to
  the discussion of which I beg to refer my readers.</p>

  <p>Sign 8 on page 47 is an indistinct compound, the first part of which I
  supposed above to be the sign of the second deity on page 46.</p>

  <p>I cannot explain 4 and 5 on page 48.</p>

  <p>As yet I do not understand sign 5 on page 49, which we seem to have
  met before on page 22c.</p>

  <p>Sign 7 on page 49 is the moon, which is very curious here.</p>

  <p>I would like to call special attention to signs 5 to 8 on page 50. I
  interpret the passage thus:&mdash;At the time of the summer solstice
  after the reappearance of the Pleiades, the change of the Venus year
  takes place (this time). I have already discussed the Venus sign in the
  sixth place and the screech-owl so closely connected with the Moan
  (Pleiades) in the seventh place. Sign 5 connects the sun (Kin) with the
  Ahau (lord) and the cross-hatching on the left of it, which I have
  assigned to the tortoise and thus to the summer solstice (Zur
  Entzifferung III, 3). Sign 8 is recognized as very appropriate to the
  change of year; compare the first sign of the middle section on pages
  25-28. All this points to the day 18 Kayab, of one of the Kan years, if,
  as I stated above, we base our computation on the middle series of
  dates.</p>

  <p>Now we have yet to examine the eight signs of the lower group, which
  we will do in the following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="ar">2</td><td class="ar">3</td><td class="pr0 ar">4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="ar">6</td><td class="ar">7</td><td class="pr0 ar">8</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Regarding the beginnings of these groups, I will venture a bold
  surmise, which will, I hope, be improved upon by some one else. It
  concerns the first sign of four of these five groups, which seem to me to
  refer to the end of the Venus year, as those above refer to the
  beginning. This sign has the following form<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:8%;">
      <a href="images/ill3.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill3.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span></p>

  <p>I see in this the term of 73 days, which is the fifth part of the 365
  days of the solar year and the eighth part of the 584 days of the Venus
  year<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>It is combined with Chuen in all four cases (pages 46, 48, 49 and 50).
  But I attribute the meaning of eight days to this Chuen sign, as I did on
  pages 25-28 and 42c-45c, though I am doubtful in these as in other
  cases.</p>

  <p>Page 46 contains the sign for 73 with a Chuen under it, and a 1
  prefixed to each sign; <i>i.e.</i>, 1 × 8 × 73 = expiration of the first
  Venus year.</p>

  <p>On page 48 Chuen follows the sign for 73 and each sign has a 3
  prefixed to it; <i>i.e.</i>, 3 × 8 × 73, expiration of the third Venus
  year.</p>

  <p>On page 49 the two signs again stand side by side, but the prefix is a
  7 instead of the expected 4. By an error this 4 has been added to the 3
  of the preceding page, but, for a wholly unintelligible reason, prefixed
  to the crouching person below the Chuen, as if to correct the 7.</p>

  <p>Page 50 again has the sign for 73 above and the Chuen below. A
  prefixed 5 would seem to be in order; instead of it, there is a 10, one 5
  for the 73 and another 5 for the 8 days. In this connection let me say
  that I believe I have found on page 27, top left, the year of 365 days
  divided into 5 × 73.</p>

  <p>Page 47 differs from the others. Above two oval bodies appears the
  cross-hatched figure resembling a clamp, like the one in the middle group
  of page 50 in the fifth place, which I ventured to refer to the summer
  solstice. There is a 1 prefixed to it. Is this equivalent to a union of
  two Venus revolutions?</p>

  <p>Next we repeatedly meet here, as we did in the middle groups, with the
  Moan sign and that of the screech-owl belonging with it; the former is
  the 6th sign on page 46 and page 50, and the latter is the 3d and 7th on
  page 47, the 7th on page 49 and finally the 2nd and 4th on page 50.</p>

  <p>The moon is represented in the 5th sign on page 48 and in the 3d on
  page 49 and indistinctly in the 4th on page 48.</p>

  <p>The cardinal points occur here several times. The 3d and 7th signs on
  page 46 have at least the superfix of the south as a <!-- Page 195
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>{195}</span>prefix; the
  8th on page 47 apparently has the east, but with the familiar
  cross-hatched sign prefixed; the 7th on page 48 plainly has the east, the
  3d on page 50 the prefix of the north prefixed to the cross <i>b</i>, and
  the 8th on page 50 the west, thus approximating the usual order and
  distribution.</p>

  <p>Of the gods I note the Akbal head, perhaps intended for D, in the 4th
  place on page 46, also in the 3d on page 48, and lastly in the 5th on
  page 49, the first two times with the Ben-Ik superfix, and in the 2nd
  place on page 47 the sign for A.</p>

  <p>In the 4th place on page 47 we have the tortoise as the sign of the
  month Kayab or of the summer solstice, in the 6th on page 47 the
  lightning-beast or the month Kankin with a Ben-Ik superfix; the beast
  itself is pictured below, and the same hieroglyph also with the Ben-Ik
  superfix is the 8th sign on page 49.</p>

  <p>It is hard to decide whether the sign 4 on page 49 represents the god
  F owing to the line through the eye, or a female by reason of the
  prefixed lock.</p>

  <p>Sign 7 on page 50 represents the deity whose sign began the series of
  twenty gods on the left of page 46 and which we have already met with
  several times in the centre of the right side. We recognize the prefix as
  having occurred in the middle group of the same page.</p>

  <p>Sign 6 on page 48 is a Kin combined with an unfamiliar sign. Sign 5 on
  page 50 contains a Kin with a Yax and probably with 18 as a superfix (as
  on pages 27 and 46 middle).</p>

  <p>Sign 6 on page 49 contains a crouching person with a 4 which is
  probably out of place here and to be regarded as a correction of the 7
  above it.</p>

  <p>Sign 5 on page 46 contains a Mac denoting the thirteenth Uinal or a
  Tonalamatl, and having the sign <i>p</i> as a superfix and a double Ik as
  a prefix.</p>

  <p>Sign 3 on page 46 merits special attention, because it contains the
  duplication of the sign, which, at the end of the first part of the
  Manuscript, pages 29-41, always began the groups of hieroglyphs on the
  lower third of the pages.</p>

  <p>I do not understand the second hieroglyph on page 46 and the 5th on
  page 47. <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page196"></a>{196}</span></p>

  <p>In conclusion I would call attention to the fact that the last
  hieroglyph on page 48 is very peculiar. As on pages 51, 52, 61 and 69 it
  has the meaning of 18,980 days and consists of an Imix with a
  comprehensive superfix; its prefix is a 7.</p>

  <p>But what is the meaning here of 7 × 18,980 = 132,860? When we recall
  the statement made above that the whole section of pages 46-50 embraces
  130,520 days, or, according to another calculation 135,200 days, it is a
  striking fact that 132,860 is exactly the mean of the two numbers, being
  separated from each by 2340 days = 9 × 260. Can it be an accident that on
  the next page (page 49) the fourth Venus revolution is reached, for 4 ×
  584 = 2336, <i>i.e.</i>, almost 2340? The hieroglyph discussed here would
  not be so extraordinary on page 50. I will not venture to assert as to
  the 511 in 132,860 = 511 × 260, that it is connected with the 511 which
  will appear as the difference on page 58.</p>

  <p>Before leaving these pages, I will give a brief survey of the two
  signs of the screech-owl and the Moan (hieroglyph <i>c</i> and the lower
  part of <i>d</i>) which occur on these pages with such marked
  frequency.</p>

  <p>In spite of obliteration, the first of these two signs is
  distinguishable in the top groups on pages 47, 49 and 50, in the middle
  groups on pages 47, 48, 49 and twice on page 50, in the lower groups on
  page 46, twice on page 47, once on 49, twice again on 50, making 14 times
  in all. A few additional cases might be added to these where the similar
  hieroglyph of the moon may have been set down instead of the one in
  question.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the second sign, always provided with the same
  prefix and suffix as the first, occurs in the top groups on page 48 and
  50, in the middle of pages 46, 48, 49 and 50, and in the lowest on pages
  46 and 50, 8 times in all.</p>

  <p>Since the subject here is astronomical, it is suggestive less of a
  deity or a sacrifice than of a period of time to which the allied page 24
  has already referred (see page 110 of this book). The inner meaning of
  these pages is of course still enveloped in mystery. <!-- Page 197
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span></p>

  <p><b>Pages 51a&mdash;52a.</b></p>

  <p>I shall begin the discussion of this very peculiar section with the
  remarkable fourth column on page 52, which, very possibly, the scribe
  ought to have placed at the beginning; for it looks like a repetition of
  the section on pages 46-50, while everything else on the left and right
  of it, apparently belongs together.</p>

  <p>If we omit the two hieroglyphs at the top, which I regard as belonging
  to the two rows of hieroglyphs extending over these two pages, we shall
  have the following result, according to my point of view<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 1</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 5</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> Chuen</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 360</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ac pr2"> 2</td>
<td class="ac pl2"> 18,980.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Since, as is frequently the case, the Chuen will here have the value
  of 8 days and the 5 with the sign for 360 may be regarded as 365, this
  group might denote 8 × 365 = 2920, but actually be 2 × 18,980 = 37,960.
  Both numbers are the basis of the section included on pages 46-50. And in
  the same way the 13 repeated 13 times seems to me to refer to the 13
  series of days on those pages, which begin with the 13th day of the
  Uinal.</p>

  <p>The two rows of hieroglyphs are in the main destroyed. We can still
  recognize in the second and third columns of page 51 the signs for end
  and beginning, which we often find in the vicinity of numbers; in the
  second and third columns of page 52, the sun and moon; in the fourth
  column, the 8 days of such significance here and in the fifth and sixth,
  the normal date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu repeated twice.</p>

  <p>As the problem on pages 46-50 was to bring into accord the solar year
  with the Venus year and consequently also the Tonalamatl, <i>i.e.</i>, to
  combine 365, 584 and 260, so the aim here is first of all to bring the
  Tonalamatl into unison with the Mercury year (115). For this purpose the
  number 11,960 is employed. This is equal to 46 × 260 = 104 × 115,
  including, therefore just as many Mercury years as there were solar years
  in the preceding section. 11,960 is also 8 × 1495, and this 8 is
  significant here, for, as we shall see directly, the day forming the
  basis <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page198"></a>{198}</span>of this calculation is XII Lamat, which
  comes 8 days after the normal date IV Ahau.</p>

  <p>The series given here is based, therefore, on 11,960 and consists
  entirely of multiples of this number, which, it is true, are recorded
  with the usual irregularity. The members of this series, representing the
  greatest values, which are set down in red numbers among the black, are
  the 31st and 39th multiples of 11,960, which are separated from each
  other by 8 × 11,960, viz:&mdash;370,760 and 466,440. All these numbers,
  of course, denote the day IV Ahau.</p>

  <p>The day XII Lamat as the actual starting-point of the Mercury
  revolution is not introduced until we come to the dates placed below the
  series. Here we find the days XII Lamat, I Akbal, III Ezanab, V Ben and
  VII Lamat written one below the other, and repeated seven times. Each of
  these days is separated from the next by 15, and the last of one row and
  the first of the next on the left are 200 days apart, hence the whole is
  equal to 7 × 260 = 1820 days. From XII Lamat begins also the Peresianus,
  pages 21-22.</p>

  <p>Now these dates are connected with the four large numbers, which we
  find on page 52, but between the third and fourth, one number
  corresponding to the day V Ben is omitted for lack of space.</p>

  <p>These four numbers, to which I have added the corresponding dates, are
  as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,412,848 = XII Lamat I Muan (6 Muluc).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,412,863 = I Akbal 16 Muan (6 Muluc).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,412,878 = III Ezanab 11 Pax (6 Muluc).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,434,748 = VII Lamat I Muan (1 Muluc).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>It is curious that while the first three are separated from each other
  by 15, between the 3d and 4th, or rather between the missing 4th and 5th,
  84 × 260 days are inserted in excess of the required 15, <i>i.e.</i>,
  21,855. This, however, is not accidental, but is due to the fact that
  between the first number and the last exactly 21,900 = 60 × 365 days have
  elapsed. This number is, however, = 18,980 + 2920, i. e., the sum of two
  very important numbers, in the first of which the Tonalamatl and the
  solar year <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page199"></a>{199}</span>accord, while both the solar and Venus
  years occur in the second.</p>

  <p>I must here call attention to the fact that the four numbers are not
  obtained without slight corrections, since in the 20-place of the third,
  I have put a 11 instead of 10, while in the 360-place of the fourth, I
  have omitted the three dots, <i>i.e.</i>, set down a 5 instead of the
  8.</p>

  <p>Of these four dates, which were doubtless not far removed from the
  time of the scribe, the three last are only the result of the first. Day
  XII Lamat is the most important. As the beginning of a Mercury period it
  should be regarded in the same way as I Ahau of the Venus period and IV
  Ahau of the solar period; and the very next day, XIII Muluc, will
  subsequently be seen to be the beginning day of the Mars period.</p>

  <p>The four dates XII Lamat, I Akbal, III Ezanab and VII Lamat are set
  down in the Manuscript directly below the numbers.</p>

  <p>Now in the first column on page 51 we again find a day XII Lamat, as
  is expressly stated beneath it. It has the number 1,578,988 and the
  corresponding date is XII Lamat 6 Cumhu (6 Kan). This day, however, is
  separated from the same day on page 52 (1,412,848 = XII Lamat I Muan 6
  Muluc) by 166,140 days, that is by 8 × 18,980 + 14,300 = 639 × 260,
  <i>i.e.</i>, by 8 so-called Katuns increased by 55 Tonalamatls. Here 58 ×
  260 = 15,080 seems to have been added to 252 (XII Lamat <span
  class="nw">-</span> IV Ahau) and the sum subtracted from 14 Ahau-Katuns =
  1,594, 320. I could obtain this number only by substituting 1 for 0 in
  the 20-place.</p>

  <p>In the Manuscript the sign XII Lamat is set down above and below this
  number. I must leave undetermined whether the 8 directly above the number
  and combined with Kin and the Katun sign refers only to the 8 Katuns or
  at the same time also to the 8 days from IV Ahau to XII Lamat.</p>

  <p>It is also to be noted here that once before on page 24 of this
  Manuscript (which forms the basis of this section) 8 × 18,980 = 151,840
  days was found to be the difference between 185,120 and 33,280, and that
  there, too, if my restoration is correct, it was the highest term of the
  series = 4 × 37,960.</p>

  <p>Finally, in the first column of page 51, we have the complete <!--
  Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page200"></a>{200}</span>normal date 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu (9 Ix). But
  below this, between red numerals denoting the 1,578,988 mentioned above,
  there is set down in black the number 1,268,800. This corresponds to the
  date IV Ahau 3 Zip (2 Cauac). It may have been formed by adding 16,120 =
  62 × 260 to 11 Ahau-Katuns = 1,252,680. It is, however, not only equal to
  4880 × 260, but also to 158,600 × 8, therefore also divisible by the
  interval between IV Ahau XII Lamat, as well as by 104 = 8 × 13, while on
  the contrary it is not as we should expect, divisible by 11,960. I have
  changed the 11, in the 20 × 11, to 8 by omitting one line and adding two
  dots, for otherwise the result would not be the one required.</p>

  <p>The magnitude of the number recalls the one on page 31, which is only
  260 less, and that on page 62.</p>

  <p>Finally it should be noted that the two large numbers on page 51 are
  separated from one another by 310,188 days = 849 years and 303 days,
  which corresponds exactly to the dates given for each. One may be
  situated as far in the future as the other is in the past, but this does
  not necessarily mean that the present coincides exactly with
  1,423,894.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 51&mdash;58.</b></p>

  <p>Thus far we have examined only the upper halves of pages 51 and 52 and
  have still to consider the lower, but not until we have finished the
  upper parts of pages 53-58 of which the former are the continuation. We
  have first to consider the series, then the pictures and lastly the
  hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>As on page 24 we found multiples of the number 2920 (= 8 × 365 = 5 ×
  584), while on pages 46-50 it was divided into four unequal parts, so on
  pages 51-52 we find multiples of the number 11,960 (104 × 115 = 46 × 260)
  while on pages 53-58 it is divided into 69 unequal parts. On pages 51-52
  it was the aim to combine only the Mercury course with the Tonalamatl,
  but here we are confronted with the additional problem of bringing the
  lunar revolution into accord with these two.</p>

  <p>The lunar revolution, which we assume to be 29.53 days, of course
  requires fractional computation, of which the Mayas either were ignorant
  or which they timorously avoided; like the ancient Egyptians, who were
  acquainted only with fractions <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>having 1 as numerator, or beyond these at
  most with &#x2154; (see Hultsch, "Die Elemente der ägyptischen
  Teilungsrechnung," 1895, page 16).</p>

  <p>Now the Mayas had determined the lunar revolution so exactly that they
  perceived the incompatibility of the period of 11,960 days with a
  multiple of lunar revolutions. They found that 405 lunar revolutions
  amounted approximately to 11,958 days, which is, in fact, the largest
  number on the second half of page 58. In order not to drop the
  significant 11,960 altogether, they made use of a very shrewd artifice.
  They took as the starting-point the day XII Lamat, corresponding to the
  number 11,960, and set down XI Manik before it and XIII Muluc after it.
  Now if the count began with XIII Muluc and ended with XI Manik, it
  actually resulted in 11,958.</p>

  <p>Therefore what the Manuscript presents here is, in the first place,
  the series, which is this time to be read from left to right. Below it
  are the three days belonging to each member of the series and then a
  number for each member stating the interval between it and the preceding
  one. The members, the days and the differences must correspond with one
  another. It is, therefore, no longer necessary to pay especial attention
  to the two latter. They will serve merely to control and to correct the
  manifold errors.</p>

  <p>The entire period of 11,958 days was doubtless first divided into
  three equal periods of 3986 days. And in order still further to subdivide
  these shorter periods, the term of 177 days was employed as far as it
  would go; 177, however, is the half of a lunar year of 354 days, made up
  of 6 months of 30 days and 6 of 29 days, thus allowing 29.5 days in round
  numbers for each month.</p>

  <p>Now 177 is = 3 × 29 + 3 × 30. The average, 29.5, however, is too short
  for the length of the lunar revolution. In order to raise it as nearly as
  possible to the exact time, two other numbers were introduced at certain
  points of the series, viz:&mdash;148 = 2 × 29 + 3 × 30, 178 = 2 × 29 + 4
  × 30. 148 = 5 months of 29.6 days, while 178 = 6 months of 29&#x2154;
  days. Now let us see in what <i>proportion</i> these 148 and 178 days
  were distributed among the periods of 177. <!-- Page 202 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>{202}</span></p>

  <p>First we see that the period of 3986 days (<i>i.e.</i>, a third of the
  whole) was divided into 3 sections of 1742, 1034 and 1210 days, as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1742 = 8 × 177 + 148 + 178</td></tr>
<tr><td>1034 = 4 × 177 + 148 + 178</td></tr>
<tr><td>1210 = 6 × 177 + 148</td></tr>
<tr><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>3986 = 18 × 177 + 3 × 148 + 2 × 178.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>This is equal to 135 months of 29.526 days each. Now the question
  arises how did the Mayas express this fraction?</p>

  <p>Perhaps some time in the future it will be found, that following their
  vigesimal system, they designated it approximately thus<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">29 + ½ + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">40</span> + <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">800</span>.</p>

  <p>The <i>whole</i> period of 11,958 days was divided as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>3 × 1742 = 24 × 177 + 3 × 148 + 3 × 178</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 × 1034 = 12 × 177 + 3 × 148 + 3 × 178</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 × 1210 = 18 × 177 + 3 × 148</td></tr>
<tr><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 × 3986 = 54 × 177 + 9 × 148 + 6 × 178.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Thus for every 6 parts of 177 days there was consequently 1 of 148 and
  to every 9 parts of 177, 1 of 178.</p>

  <p>Since 177 and 178 include 6 months each, while 148 equals 5 months,
  the entire length of the period is 405 months, which are divided into 69
  periods.</p>

  <p>It was necessary to discuss all this before I could introduce the
  entire series itself. In the following table I have set down the numbers
  and added to them the differences between each number and the preceding
  one (to the first, the interval between it and the zero point), just as
  they are given in the Manuscript. An asterisk is added to show that the
  number has been corrected by me and is wrong in the Manuscript, owing to
  a mistake either in writing or in computation. The three columns
  correspond to the three divisions of 3986 days, and the two horizontal
  lines divide the periods of 1742, 1034 and 1210 days. <!-- Page 203

  <p>No one acquainted with the cursoriness of the Maya Manuscripts will be
  surprised that among 138 numbers I have declared 21 to be wrong.
  Furthermore the 21 errors are lessened by the fact that six of them are
  really only one, for in all 6 cases where the difference is 178, the
  scribe has overlooked this and written down the usual 177, although the
  numbers and the days of the series very correctly indicate 178. Again the
  three errors in groups 58 and 59 are also only one, for the author had
  confused <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page204"></a>{204}</span>the differences 177 and 148 and had,
  therefore, to write down 10,039 instead of 10,068. In group 4 the error
  is merely the omission of a line meaning 5. The scribe must have been at
  the same time the computer and therefore the actual author of the
  Manuscript.</p>

  <p>Furthermore I must call attention to the regular position of the
  differences 178 and 148. In the three periods of 1742 days the 178 always
  occupies the 6th place and in the periods of 1034 it is always in the 4th
  place. This difference appears, therefore, in groups 6, 14, 29, 37, 52
  and 60, <i>i.e.</i>, 8, 15, 8, 15 and 8 groups apart; but it is entirely
  lacking in the periods of 1210 days. And in all nine sections the 148
  occupies the third place, <i>i.e.</i>, directly in front of the pictures,
  which will be discussed immediately, therefore in groups 3, 13, 19, 26,
  36, 42, 49, 59, 65, <i>i.e.</i>, at intervals of 10, 6, 7, 10, 6, 7, 10
  and 6 groups. But I must point out an error fraught with consequences.
  Groups 22 and 23 quite correctly have the difference 177, but in this
  single instance the scribe has written down 178 and hence has computed
  the three days belonging to it as VII Ix, VIII Men and IX Cib instead of
  VI Ben, VII Ix and VIII Men, and from here on to the close he is always
  one day in advance, so that on page 58 group 69 ends with the days X
  Cimi, XI Manik and XII Lamat, while it ought to have ended with IX
  Chicchan, X Cimi and XI Manik.</p>

  <p>So much for the series. Vid. on this series my paper "Zwei
  Hieroglyphenreihen in der Dresdener Mayahandschrift" (Zeitschrift für
  Ethnologie, 1905, numbers 2 and 3). Let us turn next to the ten pictures
  which are inserted in this series, three of which appear at the end of
  each period of 2920 days as on pages 46-50. Let us attempt to advance a
  step further in the darkness which still surrounds us here.</p>

  <p>One of these pictures, the 8th, which is on page 56b, is in the wrong
  place, owing to the error in computation in Groups 58 and 59 to which I
  called attention above. It belongs not <i>before</i> but <i>after</i>
  group 59, the first on page 56b. This is indicated in the Manuscript
  itself. For in group 59 the two hieroglyphs, usually placed above each
  group, are missing and we find instead of them the sign resembling a
  snail, which is <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page205"></a>{205}</span>doubtless a very much emphasized zero
  (compare my "Erläuterungen," page 29), which indicates that the section
  designated by a picture closes with this group.</p>

  <p>Having corrected this error we see that the ten pictures are on the
  following pages and come after the following numbers of the series<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>From this it follows that a picture is assigned to each of the nine
  sections composing the series. They are placed, however, not at the
  beginning or end of the section, but always after the expiration of 502
  (= 2 × 177 + 148) days. The pictures are thus separated from one another
  by 1742, 1034 and 1210 days, which intervals correspond exactly to the
  length of the nine sections. But the last picture is separated from the
  preceding one by 708 days, and as it has a character quite its own, it
  must be discussed separately. But these 708 days with the 502 days of the
  beginning quite regularly amount to 1210 days, and the series is
  therefore to be considered as a recurring one.</p>

  <p>Now these nine pictures might very easily be regarded as forming a new
  series, which is inserted in the original one and which has the day 502
  as its zero-point. In that case, we shall have to subtract 502 every time
  from the days set down in the Manuscript. This new series may be
  represented thus<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>It is certainly remarkable that the last number, 10748, corresponds so
  closely to the time of the revolution of Saturn, which is computed at
  10753 days. For owing to the slowness of its progress, the Mayas may have
  known not only the apparent but also the actual revolution of Saturn.
  Besides the apparent revolution of Saturn (378 days from one superior
  conjunction to the next) could not be made to coincide very well with the
  length of the solar year. I will immediately present a further
  confirmation of my theory.</p>

  <p>All these pictures have rectangles above them, of which I have spoken
  in my "Erläuterungen," page 16, and which always enclosed two or three
  hieroglyphs in which, with due hesitation, I assumed to be the signs of
  the sun, moon, and planets. This theory has as yet called forth no
  serious opposition.</p>

  <p>Now in the passages just mentioned, I indicated the following figures
  as the signs of Saturn<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">
      <a href="images/ill4.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill4.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>These figures actually occur in all the nine pictures with the
  exception of the first, which has no rectangle at all, and where in true
  Maya fashion, the zero-point is concealed.</p>

  <p>I go still further in my bold hypothesis. The time of the apparent
  revolution of Jupiter has been placed at 397 days. The Mayas, I think,
  computed it at 398 days. In the passage alluded to I regarded the
  following as the sign for Jupiter<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/ill5.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill5.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>We find these signs in pictures 4, 6, 7 and 9. The corresponding
  numbers reduced for the revolution of Saturn are <!-- Page 207 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>{207}</span>3986, 6762, 7972 and
  10,748. I assume that the third picture, <i>i.e.</i>, the number 2776, is
  another zero-point, in consequence of which the sign is here suppressed,
  and that still another is the tenth picture with the number 11,958, which
  has no relation to the revolution of Saturn.</p>

  <p>If we compare these numbers with the 398, <i>i.e.</i>, the apparent
  revolution of Jupiter, we have the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The differences 10, 6, 4, 12, 2 and 18 are so small in comparison with
  398, that the numbers 2776, etc., might very well have been regarded as
  approximate multiples of the revolution of Jupiter. And the remainders in
  the seventh and tenth pictures could be still further reduced. In the
  seventh picture, the first sign is very unusual and one which I do not
  remember having met with elsewhere. If it should be possible to regard it
  as the number of the thirteen week days, then it would follow (the Saturn
  sign being regarded as unimportant) that the contents of the rectangle
  meant:&mdash; 13 + a multiple of 398, by which this remainder would be
  reduced to <span class="nw">-1.</span></p>

  <p>The tenth picture has the cross <i>b</i> as the beginning of the
  rectangle. This is the sign for union, very often denoting especially the
  union of all the twenty days. Thus we have here (aside from the middle
  sign to be discussed later) the formula<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span>
  20 + 30 × 398 <span class="nw">-</span> 2 = 11,958, or even 20 + 30 × 398
  = 11,960.</p>

  <p>The regular progression from the 7th multiple to the 10th, 17th, 20th,
  27th, and 30th multiples in the above six equations is also somewhat in
  favor of my theory, while the four rectangles without the Jupiter sign
  are by no means multiples of the Jupiter revolution<span

  <p>Let us now try to interpret the meaning of the remaining rectangles
  (always omitting the Saturn sign as a matter of course.)</p>

  <p>In pictures 2 and 8 the rectangle also contains the sign of the moon
  or of the twenty days. Beside it in picture 2 is the sign, which in my
  "Erläuterungen," page 16, I regarded as the sign for Mercury. Hence we
  have here 20 + 15 × 115 = 1745, <i>i.e.</i>, only 3 units more than the
  required 1742.</p>

  <p>The rectangle with the eighth picture contains in addition to the moon
  a sign which looks as if it were intended for a whole divided into four
  parts. Until something better (perhaps the the sign of Venus) is
  proposed, I will assume that it is the quarter of the Tonalamatl,
  <i>i.e.</i>, 65, and I take the required number to be 9714 in the form of
  20 + 149 × 65 + 9.</p>

  <p>Above the third picture I see a Mercury and a Venus sign and I read
  584 + 19 × 115 = 2769, which is only 7 units less than the required
  2776.</p>

  <p>The fifth picture still remains to be discussed, but I do not know how
  to unite the Mercury revolution here with the 5728. For the present,
  however, I am inclined to believe that there is a mistake in this
  passage.</p>

  <p>We pass now from the obscure contents of the rectangles to the equally
  mysterious pictures themselves.</p>

  <p>Aside from the tenth picture, I find human forms in four pictures.</p>

  <p>Picture 1, page 53a, is the death-god (A) seated and pointing upward,
  an appropriate representation for the zero-point of the Saturn series,
  <i>i.e.</i>, for the end of the preceding revolution.</p>

  <p>Picture 2, page 55a, contains the head of a deity, probably D's with
  the suggestion of a beard and the sun-sign on his forehead. The head is
  surrounded by a ring striped black and white.</p>

  <p>Picture 3, page 56a, is the head of B, again with a beard and with the
  sign Kin (sun) above. The head is surrounded by a design, the left part
  of which is black and the right white.</p>

  <p>Picture 6, page 53b, represents a hanged woman, which Schellhas,
  "Göttergestalten," page 11, takes to be the Maya goddess Ixtab, the
  goddess of the halter, <i>i.e.</i>, of the hanged. <!-- Page 209 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span></p>

  <p>The centre of picture 4 on page 57a, contains the suggestion of a
  face, perhaps in place of the Ahau sign, and on either side of it is a
  black and white surface.</p>

  <p>It is further important to note that four times in this section Kin
  (sun) forms the centre of the picture, viz:&mdash;pictures 5, 7, 8 and 9,
  pages 52b, 54b, 56b and 57b. In all four cases there is on either side of
  Kin a black and white surface, such as we have already seen in picture 4
  and similar to that in picture 3. Pictures 8 and 9 are vomited up, as it
  were, by a serpent placed below them, in the same way as B is represented
  on pages 34b and 35b. In pictures 5 and 8, four objects suggesting arrows
  extend from the Kin in four directions and probably denote the four
  cardinal points or the four Bacabs, of which we shall have more to say
  presently. Two of these arrow-like signs also appear in picture 7, page
  54b, but only on the black and not on the white surface.</p>

  <p>I will postpone discussing picture 10 until later and pass on to the
  hieroglyphs above the first nine pictures, about which it is true I have
  nothing satisfactory to say. There are always properly speaking ten of
  these hieroglyphs, among them the two signs for the sun and moon. But the
  scribe introduced the latter only in pictures 1-4, and also with the more
  elaborate last picture 10. With pictures 5 and 9 he omitted these signs
  in order to represent the other eight larger and with greater
  distinctness of detail. Among these hieroglyphs are several of gods,
  especially that of A with pictures 1, 5 and 9, and H with picture 5, and
  with pictures 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 there are other heads, some of them
  bird-heads, regarding which I am uncertain.</p>

  <p>The Ben-Ik sign, to which I have assigned the meaning of a lunar
  month, belongs with pictures 4, 8 and 9 and occurs twice each with
  pictures 1 and 10.</p>

  <p>I am inclined to see the sign for Mercury in the crouching figure
  belonging to pictures 9 and 10, which is drawn upside down and combined
  with the half Venus sign (11958 = 104 × 115 <span class="nw">-</span>
  2).</p>

  <p>Hands grasping a hieroglyph (a sign for 20 days?) are represented in
  pictures 1, 7, 8 and 10.</p>

  <p>The enigmatical numbers, prefixed to the hieroglyphs, occur <!-- Page
  210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>several
  times, thus a 1 with pictures 1 and 10, and a 4 twice with picture 8 and
  a 6 with picture 3.</p>

  <p>Now let us examine picture 10 somewhat in detail and also the signs
  standing above it, since both are of special significance here. This
  representation treats of the period of 11,960 days in which the Mercury
  and lunar revolutions meet. And this is proved by the ten hieroglyphs,
  which I will number as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 6</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">2</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 7</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">3</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 8</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">4</td><td class="pr0 ar"> 9</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="pr0 ar">10</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>I can omit Signs 3 and 8, sun and moon, since they refer to a period
  of time only in a general way. Sign 1 seems to me, as I have already
  stated, to have reference to the revolutions of Mercury. Then follows
  sign 2, the upper part of which is a mat and the lower the Muluc sign. I
  believe this sign is intended to denote that the beginning of this period
  is in a Muluc year. Indeed, our examination of pages 51-52 showed that it
  was the year 6 Muluc. The mat (Pop) is very properly the symbol of
  beginning, since the first month of the year was likewise called Pop.
  Sign 7, it seems to me, indicates that this period should be divided into
  lunar months (denoted by Ben-Ik), and, as I have already demonstrated in
  my examination of page 24, the length of the period is stated here by
  Signs 4, 5, 6 and 9, but the dot before the fifth should be placed before
  the fourth, as is actually the case on page 24. Therefore<span

  <p>It is perhaps not accidental that the ninth sign is that of the
  fourteenth month, which signifies the expiration of the preceding lunar
  month, for here the month begins with the first day of the fifteenth
  month. <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span></p>

  <p>Sign 10 is doubtless Xul = end, as it so often is, for example, on
  pages 61-62 below. But I have not solved the meaning of the two prefixes.
  The end would be XII Lamat 16 Yax (13 Ix).</p>

  <p>The picture represents a human form, which has in place of a head a
  design somewhat resembling the head of a lance. It is sitting with legs
  spread apart, and in this respect may be compared with god B of Cort. 9,
  who is represented in the same way. In the picture before us, the figure
  holds in its upraised hands the sun and moon signs, which are constantly
  repeated throughout the series. The Venus sign is placed between the
  outspread legs. In the rectangle above the figure, this sign is repeated
  in a more concise form, while on the left the cross <i>b</i> appears as
  the sign of union or multiplication, and on the right that of Jupiter,
  whose period of revolution is here multiplied by 30 (30 × 398 = 11,940).
  And the two Venus signs can mean nothing more than that this period of
  11,960 also serves the purpose of filling up the gap between the two
  large Venus-solar periods of 37,960 days, like the similar process which
  we saw on pages 46-50.</p>

  <p>We have examined first the series and then the pictures with the
  hieroglyphs belonging to them. Let us pass now, as the third step, to the
  examination of the two rows of hieroglyphs extending above the numbers
  throughout the whole section. First of all, I will again set down here
  the position of each of the sixty-nine groups<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Since each group contains two hieroglyphs, this makes 138. in all. Of
  these, however, about 24 on the upper halves of the pages, are wholly or
  almost wholly effaced which very materially hinders the trustworthy
  determination of the context.</p>

  <p>Furthermore group 59 is entirely lacking or rather group 58, in the
  place of which the 59th has been set down. The eighth <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>picture was
  probably already drawn, when the artist saw that there was not room
  enough left for the 58th and 59th groups. Hence he omitted the 58th,
  setting down in place of it the 59th and in the place of the latter he
  set down the zero mentioned above.</p>

  <p>The question now arises:&mdash;Are these hieroglyphs dependent upon
  the days and numbers of the series and upon the pictures, or are they
  entirely independent of them?</p>

  <p>I find but <i>one</i> point in favor of the first possibility,
  viz:&mdash;the Venus sign in group 4b (I will designate the upper
  hieroglyphs by <i>a</i> and the lower by <i>b</i>). It is placed in the
  period indicated in which 502-679 days elapse, and in which, therefore,
  Venus has finished a revolution of 584 days. It may be, that by way of
  exception, this significant date was intentionally recorded.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, there are many things, which favor an entirely
  different interpretation of these hieroglyphs. Thus I am of the opinion
  that the ritual year of 364 days with its four Bacab periods of 91 days
  each is referred to here, as we have already found it referred to on
  pages 31a-32a and on page 45a, and shall find it again on pages 65-69 and
  71-73. In that case the single groups would be separated from one another
  by one Maya week = 13 days.</p>

  <p>I will now arrange the sixty-nine groups in the following order (the
  reason for which will become clear directly)<span

  <p>The groups in a horizontal row are separated from one another by 7 or
  a multiple of 7. If now a hieroglyph is repeated in those places, which
  are in the same horizontal row, then this is a confirmation of the
  supposition that Bacab periods are meant to be represented here. Hence I
  will examine each row in turn. These rows extend over the long period of
  69 × 13 days probably merely for the purpose of filling up the space.
  <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>I. In 39b, 46b, 53b and 60b, <i>i.e.</i>, after every seven groups,
  perhaps also in 18b, we find the following sign, which I identified as
  that of a Bacab, in Globus, Vol. LXXI<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:12%;">
      <a href="images/ill6.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill6.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Hence this denotes the beginning of the Bacab period. In 4b the sign
  is replaced by that for Venus. In 11b, 25b, 32b and 67b we find other
  signs, it is true, nevertheless the regularity stated above cannot be
  accidental. The upper signs of groups 39a, 46a, 53a and 60a contain an
  Imix and corroborate the connection.</p>

  <p>II. 5b and 26b (after 3 × 91 days) contain a head very like the
  preceding, which readily suggests the idea that it is merely a Bacab sign
  pushed one group ahead, but it also appears in 13b, 50b and 52b.</p>

  <p>Then 12b, 54b and 61b correspond, <i>i.e.</i>, after six groups of 91
  days and one more of the same length, but the same sign appears also in
  34b, 48b and 56b.</p>

  <p>III. 41b and 69a are Xul = end and are therefore separated by 28 × 13
  = 4 × 91 days, <i>i.e.</i>, the length of a year. It is singular that
  both signs of 41 are like those of 47; if we assume that 47 was set down
  one group too soon, it would be in excellent keeping with the rest. The
  Xul also appears in 11b and 28b. 34b and 48b correspond after 2 × 91
  days, as already mentioned under II.</p>

  <p>IV. 42a and 49b both contain the sign for the sun between clouds.</p>

  <p>V. 36b and 57b agree after 3 × 91 days; the same sign appears again in
  10b and 20b.</p>

  <p>15a and 36a correspond after 3 × 91 days; we shall continue the
  examination of this sign under pages 71-73.</p>

  <p>VI. 37a and 65a agree, <i>i.e.</i>, after 4 × 91 days = a year. The
  sign contains a human figure stretching both arms aloft. The passing of a
  year was likewise indicated in III, but a year coming 52 days later than
  this. <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page214"></a>{214}</span></p>

  <p>VII. 10a and 31a agree, <i>i.e.</i>, after 3 × 91 days. The sign is
  composed of the crouching figure prefixed to the cross, which we also
  find in 12b, 35a and 65b; it is prefixed to a different hieroglyph in
  30a. In 38b, 52b and 59b (58 in the Manuscript) we see bird-like heads
  resembling the Bacab sign. We should expect to find a familiar sign in
  45, which is drawn between these, but a Moan appears there instead. These
  signs seem to indicate the end of the Bacab period. Does the Moan sign
  here, too, suggest the end of the year?</p>

  <p>In 38a, 52a and 59a we again see an Imix, and I consider it a
  corroboration of my theory that all the four signs of groups 38 and 39
  are repeated in 52 and 53 after 2 × 91 days.</p>

  <p>I believe a further corroboration is the fact that though many of
  these hieroglyphs have no connection with these periods of 7 × 13,
  <i>i.e.</i>, with the divisions of the ritual year, they do correspond
  with the usual divisions of the Tonalamatl, <i>i.e.</i>, 4 × 13 and 5 ×
  13 days.</p>

  <p>After 4 × 13 or a multiple of it the signs recur in 20b, 24b, 40b,
  44b-12b, 48b, 56b-16b, 32b, 64b-26b, 50b-10a, 30a-37a, 65a-15b, 51b-11b
  and 47b.</p>

  <p>As examples of 5 × 13 I would mention 3b, 63b-10a, 20a, 30a-5b,
  50b-24b, 29b-35b, 65b-15b, 20b, 40b.</p>

  <p>Finally, I must mention two more hieroglyphs, which are limited almost
  entirely to these pages<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/ill7.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/ill7.png"
      alt="Glyph" title="Glyph" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the first sign, which occurred on page 10a, I thought I recognized
  the lunar month of 28 days. It occurs in this section in connection with
  the third picture on page 56, and besides in the following groups of
  hieroglyphs:&mdash;16b, 32b and 64b, always combined with a Yax. The
  regularity of the intervals is striking, but as yet I can neither explain
  that, nor the crouching personage (Mercury?) in the 10th, 20th and 30th
  groups and again in the next, the 31st.</p>

  <p>The second sign is found <i>only</i> on these pages and here not less
  than eleven times, possibly with the addition of the <!-- Page 215
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span>effaced sign
  in 6b and 27b which may have been the same hieroglyph. The eleven places
  in which it occurs are as follows:&mdash;3b, 15b, 17b, 23b, 24b, 29b,
  40b, 44b, 49a, 51b and 63b. Two different prefixes are added to it; one
  in the first two and the last two places and also in the last but two
  joined with Kin, and the other in the six middle places. Of the eleven
  groups, 17 and 24, 44 and 51 are 7 groups apart, 3 and 17, 15 and 29, 49
  and 63 are 14 groups apart, 23 and 44 are 21 groups apart, and hence 23
  and 51 are separated by 28 groups or 1 year. Group 40 alone is not
  concerned with these intervals of seven or multiples of seven.</p>

  <p>Now, how far may all these periods of time be due to accident and how
  far to design? Accident <i>alone</i> is quite out of the question. The
  frequent repetition of the sun-sign in groups 49, 50 and 51 on pages 54b
  and 55b, seems to me to refer to the conjunctions of the sun with certain
  stars, which occur at intervals of thirteen days.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 58&mdash;59.</b></p>

  <p>This section is also based on a series occupying the whole of page 59,
  which contains nothing but number and day signs. This series has the
  difference 78, which we found once before on page 44. There the
  starting-point was III Lamat, here it is the day XIII Muluc, probably
  coming in the year XIII Muluc, as in Cort. 40b, as I shall have occasion
  to suggest later. The series extends, with the usual errors and
  variations, in four divisions from top to bottom. The days, which are
  always two days behindhand, owing to the number 78, in 780 again reach
  the day XIII Muluc, at which point the succeeding members remain
  stationary, since from here on the difference is always 780 or a multiple
  of it. 780 days are, however, the apparent time of the revolution of
  Mars, which is the only planet now left to be discussed, the subject of
  pages 46-50 having been Venus and the sun, and of pages 51-58, Mercury
  and the moon with incidental treatment of Saturn and Jupiter. With 780 as
  its difference, the series ascends to 19 × 780 = 14,820, and then
  continues with this large number as its difference until the series is
  lost in the effaced passages. <!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page216"></a>{216}</span></p>

  <p>Curiously enough, however, directly under the line containing the
  14,820, there is a new series composed of nine members, or ten counting
  the suppressed starting-point. But this starting-point is again the day
  IX Ik, the difference, as proved by the annexed days, is again 78 and the
  series ends with 780. Thus the starting-point is the only difference
  between the two series. The principal series contains all the even and
  the secondary series all the uneven days. Can the starting-point of the
  revolution of Mars have been determined according to different
  principles? Is it possible that in one case the beginning of the planet's
  retrogression was adopted as the starting-point, and in the other case
  the date on which the planet, after completing its retrograde course,
  again reached the degree of right ascension at which it had begun its
  retrogression? This is a difficult matter to decide, since the period of
  the retrogression of Mars fluctuates between 62 and 81 days. The interval
  from IX Ik to XIII Muluc is 147 and in reversed order 113 days.</p>

  <p>It can hardly be assumed that the 19 of the IX 19 or IX Ik is
  connected with the 19 × 780 mentioned above or with the 19 + 19 + 19 + 21
  into which the 78 is divided on pages 44-45, or finally with the 19,
  which four times forms the principal part of the sub-divisions of 65 on
  pages 33-34.</p>

  <p>Numbers amounting to millions accompany this series in the usual way.
  Two of these are on page 58, viz:&mdash;1,426,360 and 1,386,580; but with
  the sign of the sixth day, which is important here, between them. Below
  these numbers, however, are two month dates:&mdash;first the normal date
  IV Ahau 8 Cumhu and, if I have correctly restored the effaced number
  before the month sign, which in its turn is indistinct, the second is
  XIII Muluc 2 Zac, which would fall in the year VIII Muluc. The encircled
  numbers also occur here. They are set down beside the lower number of
  seven figures. We find here a red 12 with a black 1 inserted, below this
  a black 7 and below this again, enclosed in a red band, a black 11, which
  I regard as also representing the value of a red number. We shall find a
  similar instance among the serpent numerals. Then we have here 1. 7. 11.
  = 511 and 12. 11. = 251. But 511 = 260 + 251 and 251 is the interval
  between XIII Muluc and IV Ahau. <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span></p>

  <p>With the day XIII Muluc and the interval 9 between IV Ahau and XIII
  Muluc, numbers for XIII Muluc have been formed amounting to millions,
  which, however, have been suppressed in the Manuscript, just as they were
  on page 31 where, in like manner, numbers were first formed for day XIII
  Akbal.</p>

  <p>I assume that to begin with, 76 Tonalamatls (= 19,760) were added to
  this 9 and then 228 Tonalamatls (= 59,280), the 228 being = 3 × 76 and
  the 59,280 including 76 revolutions of Mars.</p>

  <p>The result in one case was 19,769 and in the other 59,289. If the 12
  Ahau-Katuns, which are specified as 1,366,560 on page 24b be added here,
  we have the following numbers<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,386,329 = XIII Muluc 2 Mol (3 Muluc),</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,425,849 = XIII Muluc 2 Zip (12 Muluc),</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>and if the two encircled numbers of the Manuscript:&mdash;251 and 511
  be added, the sums are 1,386,580 and 1,426,360, <i>i.e.</i>, the two
  large numbers of the Manuscript.</p>

  <p>The dates corresponding to these numbers are as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,386,580 = IV Ahau 13 Muan (12 Muluc),</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,426,360 = IV Ahau 8 Muan (4 Ix).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>If we compare the two numbers with the normal date, the curious result
  follows that<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1) 1,386,580 - 1,366,560 = 20,020.</p>

  <p>This number is equal to 55 × 364, including therefore the ritual year
  of 364 days.</p>

  <p>2) 1,426,360 - 1,366,560 = 59,800.</p>

  <p>This number is five times 11,960 days, which is assumed to be the time
  in which the lunar and Mercury revolutions accord. This 59,800 was found
  once before on page 24 as the suppressed difference between 68,900 and
  9,100.</p>

  <p>Thus the separate sections (of the book) are very closely
  connected.</p>

  <p>If the two large numbers be compared with one another their difference
  will be found to be 39,780. This is equal first to 51 Mars revolutions of
  780 days, and second to 4420 × 9, <i>i.e.</i>, a multiple of the interval
  between IV Ahau and XIII Muluc.</p>

  <p>Now we must direct our attention to the seventeen hieroglyphs, which
  we find in the two columns on page 58, apart from the matter-of-course
  calendar date at the top, which is repeated <!-- Page 218 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page218"></a>{218}</span>at the bottom. One
  column contains 11 hieroglyphs and the other 6. I will here advance the
  following theory in regard to these hieroglyphs, which may serve until a
  better is found<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Since, as a rule, the Tonalamatl is divided into 5 × 52 days, I
  believe that each group of three Tonalamatls treated of on page 59, is
  divided into 15 of these parts; that each hieroglyph, therefore, denotes
  52 days and that the first three parts are separated from the others by
  the signs of beginning and end in the first and fifth places, so that
  three of these parts, which equal 156 days, always form a separate group.
  156 is the 5th part of 780. With the omission of the first and fifth
  signs, the passage, I think, stands thus<span

  <p>If we adopt this arrangement for the present we cannot fail to see
  that the author had an aim in view, when we consider the following<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. The zero-point lies 15,609 days later than the normal date IV Ahau
  8 Cumhu (9 Ix). This is equal to 20 × 780 or 60 × 260 increased by the
  interval between IV Ahau and XIII Muluc = 9. There are 86 days between 2
  Kankin and 8 Cumhu <i>i.e.</i>, 15,609 = 43 × 365 <span
  class="nw">-</span> 86, and from 9 Ix to 13 Muluc it is 43 years. <!--
  Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span></p>

  <p>2. The same zero-point, 13 Muluc, lies in the year with the same name,
  that is, the very point where a Tonalamatl of the year ends.</p>

  <p>3. In this arrangement the first as well as the last day of the year 1
  Ix is exactly reached in the second and ninth groups. While the meaning
  of the second is as yet unintelligible to me, the end of the year is
  appropriately indicated by the ninth with its compound of Kin and the
  year-sign, above which there may be an Ix as a superfix, but misshapen
  for want of room.</p>

  <p>4. Also the fact that it is the first of the two columns, which closes
  with this year-end, seems to show a purpose.</p>

  <p>5. Several instances of similarity appear among the hieroglyphs in
  these groups of three:&mdash;an Akbal sign in 1 and 4 suggests the god D,
  the superfix and prefix of 2 and 14 the god K and 5 and 11 the
  screech-owl and therefore A.</p>

  <p>Little else is to be said of these hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>C might be denoted by 3 (13 Zip) and 10 (12 Zip). Group 8, the central
  point of the series, has on the left and right the signs for the north
  and south as if the time between the north (Muluc) years and the south
  (Cauac) years were meant to be indicated here.</p>

  <p>I am inclined to consider the crouching personage in 12 as the
  revolution of Mercury, which requires 115 days:&mdash;573 is 5 × 114 + 3
  or 5 × 115 <span class="nw">-</span> 2.</p>

  <p>Is 7 a sign, as yet unknown, for the year of 364 days?</p>

  <p>15 looks like two signs for the month Mac, placed back to back, which
  here designates the Tonalamatl as it does on page 24. The superfix of
  three parts might denote three Tonalamatls = 780 days. The familiar sign
  in the fifth place in connection with the expiration of the first
  Tonalamatl is striking; it is the one usually identified as that of the
  screech-owl or death-bird.</p>

  <p><b>Page 60.</b></p>

  <p>This is the last page of the front of the second part and is divided
  into four sections:&mdash;at the top we find hieroglyphs, below these a
  picture, then hieroglyphs again and in the lowest section another
  picture. <!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page220"></a>{220}</span></p>

  <p>The upper picture contains first a rectangular elevation like a
  platform. Enclosed in this rectangle is the picture of the animal
  resembling a dog lying down, which we have often met with, the last time
  on page 47. In front of the dog is a hieroglyph, which, I regret to say,
  is still unknown and which occurred six times as a heading on page 23b.
  On the platform two personages are fighting; one is in war-dress holding
  in his left hand the throwing-stick or atlatl, and in his right probably
  arrows; the other figure, whose back is somewhat indistinct owing to
  obliteration, is apparently unarmed and is making a defensive gesture
  with one hand. Beside the platform, and therefore on a lower level, is a
  second person walking behind the armed person as if to help him. He too
  is in war-dress and likewise holds an atlatl. A black 3 is set down
  between the two combatants, and there may also have been a red 2, which
  is indistinct owing to the red background of the picture.</p>

  <p>Let us next examine the lower picture. A blindfolded personage is
  kneeling on the left. A serpent's head rises from the ground in front of
  him. A second serpent rises in several coils on the shoulders of the
  blindfolded personage and on the serpent's neck sits enthroned another
  personage, who is rather indistinct, holding a spear and a shield. On the
  right, opposite this group and facing it, is a second. A personage with
  arms bound and bowed head is sitting on the ground. There is a black ring
  around his eye. Behind him stands the victor in war-dress and again
  equipped with spear and shield. There is a red 11 and a black 2 between
  the two groups.</p>

  <p>We see that the reference here is to combat, just as it was on the
  right side of pages 46-50. And since the subject of these pages like that
  of 46-59 is confined to the revolutions of the planets, it is natural
  that the pursuit of one by the other, their periodical disappearance, the
  crossing of their orbits and the variation in the length of their
  revolutions should be looked upon as a contest. Therefore, since the sun,
  the moon and the five planets have hitherto been treated of on these
  pages, I look for these seven heavenly bodies in the seven personages
  pictured here on page 60. I will attempt to explain them, hoping that my
  interpretation may be replaced by a better one. <!-- Page 221 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span></p>

  <p>The sun and moon stand on the platform in the upper picture; their
  combat is equivalent to the eclipses to which they at times succumb. The
  moon is the assailant and the sun makes only a proud defensive gesture.
  The person behind the moon must be Mars. The animal under the two persons
  is the embodiment of the eclipses, which the Aztecs interpreted as the
  act of being devoured by the jaguar. The hieroglyph in front looks very
  much like the meeting of two circles. Does it refer to the day Lamat
  (Aztec tochtli = rabbit)?</p>

  <p>At the left, bottom, the powerful Venus triumphs over the weak
  Mercury. The two planets are real chronometers by reason of the regular
  alternation of their appearance as morning and evening stars, and also by
  their disappearance twice in each revolution and finally even in the
  variation in the length of the two periods of invisibility. Hence they
  are each accompanied by a serpent as the usual symbol of time.</p>

  <p>On the right, on the other hand, Jupiter as the stronger has
  vanquished Saturn, whose bound arms symbolize his slowness of motion and
  the fact that he is confined to the same region of the sky. Should not
  the ring around his eye have a very special meaning? But we must guard
  against an excess of imagination. Jupiter and Saturn are the last to be
  represented, as they were of but secondary importance, on pages 51-58 and
  perhaps also in the 2200 on page 24.</p>

  <p>I will not deny that yet another interpretation of this page is
  possible. The top picture may be Venus and the moon opposing one another,
  and the bottom picture may represent the sun as victor over Mercury.
  There are some things in favor of this point of view.</p>

  <p>The correct order of the twenty-four hieroglyphs is the following, in
  my opinion, which is borne out by the different colors of the four
  groups<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

  <p>These signs can have no relation to mythology. There is not a
  hieroglyph of a god among them, for if sign 6 could be taken for B's
  hieroglyph, the resemblance to the sign of the fist, familiar from the
  inscriptions, as well as the Imix and the cross-hatching as a prefix,
  makes this doubtful. The latter component would rather suggest the summer
  solstice. If sign 12 were intended to denote the Bacab, then it would
  refer to chronology rather than to mythology. Also the Cimi in 17 might
  equally well mean the day as the god. Indeed several things refer here to
  chronology and astronomy, among them the unmistakable union of numbers
  and month signs, which occur here repeatedly. Thus from what remains of
  the almost obliterated signs 1 and 2, they might denote the normal date
  IV Ahau 8 Cumhu, which always occupies the first place. Signs 7 and 20
  are plainly the same, 9 Xul (sixth month) and sign 14 is 10 Yaxkin
  (seventh month). Sign 5 might be Caban combined with Uo (second month)
  and a ten. In sign 19 we again see Yaxkin without a number. Signs 9 and
  23 are Zec (fifth month) and signs 21 and 22 may be Kankin (fourteenth
  month). The days occur in the same manner as the months. It is true that
  Kin is only a part of hieroglyph 10, the rest of which is effaced, but
  the familiar compound of Caban and Muluc appears in 18 and 24 and Cimi is
  in 17, as we have seen. In sign 13, Ahau is combined with a red number,
  which must lie between X and XV. But this should not be regarded as
  forming a calendar date with the 10 Yaxkin near by, for Ahau is never the
  tenth day of a month. Can 16 be the sign of the twelfth month, Ceh,
  combined with that for 7200? Hieroglyphs 3 and 8 are effaced and I do not
  understand 4, 11 and 15.</p>

  <p>There are no parallels in the kindred passages 46-50, unless it be 7
  Zec on the bottom of page 49 and here in signs 9 and 23, but without a
  number. Cf. my paper on this page 60 in the "Weltall," year 6, pages
  251-257.</p>

  <p><b>Page 61&mdash;64.</b></p>

  <p>On examining the reverse of the second part of our Manuscript,
  <i>i.e.</i>, pages 61-74, we find an empty page on the left, the back of
  which is occupied by page 60. This may be explained by assuming that the
  scribe wrote pages 61-64 and possibly <!-- Page 223 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>{223}</span>even pages 61-74 from
  right to left, the great series having occasioned such a proceeding, and
  that his material came to an end when he had finished page 61.
  Nevertheless, it is advisable to continue with the original numbering in
  order to avoid confusion.</p>

  <p>Aside from the concluding (or beginning) page 74, this whole section
  of pages 61-74 consists of three parts:&mdash;61-64, 65-69 and 70-73. Let
  us first consider the first section, which I have already discussed in my
  treatise "Zur Erläuterung der Mayahandschriften II."</p>

  <p>The basis of this section is a series, the beginning of which is on
  the bottom, right, of page 64. Its primary difference is always that
  which we found on pages 31-32, viz:&mdash;the Bacab period of 91 days,
  the quarter of the ritual year of 364 days = 7 weeks of 13 days each. It
  ascends by 91 until it reaches 1820, which number is a multiple of both
  364 and 260 and is also divisible by 28, the number of weeks in a year.
  Just as on page 32 the series continues with the new difference 1820 as
  far as 7280, its fourth multiple, which then becomes the third
  difference. Indeed, I believe that even the partially effaced numbers
  could be so restored as to carry the series to the number 36,400 = 400 ×
  91, which would then become the fourth difference and the series would
  close at the top of page 63 with 145,600 = 1600 × 91, <i>i.e.</i>, with
  the numbers 1. 0. 4. 8. 0. of which the 1 is entirely and the 0 half
  effaced. The series on pages 31-32, however, closed with 29,120 = 320 ×
  91, but there is still room for a higher series.</p>

  <p>Under this largest number (1600 × 91) there is on page 63 a large red
  number consisting of 19. 0. 4. 4. which is crowded into a very small
  space between the figures of 1820. I can only understand it by replacing
  the first 4 by a 3, for then it is 136,864 = 1504 × 91 or by addition of
  a zero. We shall return to this number in the examination of the serpent
  numerals.</p>

  <p>The series is accompanied in the regular way by five days. At the
  beginning of this series, page 64, right bottom, are the days III Cib,
  III Men, III Chicchan, III Caban and XIII Ix; the III is set down only
  with the first of these days and is to be <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>supplied with the next
  three. Hence the actual zero point is to be found 91 days back in the
  days III Chicchan, III Kan, III Ix, III Cimi and XIII Akbal, the last of
  which is also the beginning of the corresponding series on page 32. From
  1820 on, these last-named days, of course unchanged, accompany the
  numbers. The most important of these days are the first and last, but we
  shall see later in connection with the serpent numbers that the other
  three, which are separated from one another by 39, 130 and 52,
  <i>i.e.</i>, 3 × 13, 10 × 13 and 4 × 13, are likewise not set down here
  by mere accident.</p>

  <p>We come now to the five columns, three on page 63 and two on page 62,
  which join this series on the left. They contain the large numbers, which
  invariably accompany these series. Here there are six numbers, four of
  which, in my opinion, refer to the past and two to the future. Two of
  these numbers, the two largest, are set down together in the third column
  on page 63, one with red numbers and the other with black. Of these black
  numbers, I take the second from the top to be not 8 but 13, assuming that
  a line is omitted. The normal date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu from which, as the
  starting-point, all these numbers are to be computed, is set down below
  at the end of each of the five columns.</p>

  <p>I now give the six numbers, first the two highest, then the other four
  from right to left, adding in each case the calendar date and the year in
  which they should be situated<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr025">1,538,342; IV Ik </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 15 </td><td class="pl0"> Zac (12 Muluc).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,535,004; VII Kan </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 2 </td><td class="pl0"> Chen (3 Kan).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,268,540; IV Ahau </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 8 </td><td class="pl0"> Mol (1 Ix).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,234,220; IV Ahau </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 18 </td><td class="pl0"> Kayab (11 Kan).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,272,544; IV Kan </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 17 </td><td class="pl0"> Yaxkin (12 Muluc).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,272,921; IV Imix </td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 9 </td><td class="pl0"> Mol (13 Ix).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The first, third and fifth numbers are already known from page 31a,
  and hence they need no further discussion here.</p>

  <p>As these three numbers depend on the day XIII Akbal, so the other
  three all proceed from the day III Chicchan in the following positions,
  which are again suppressed in the Manuscript<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page225"></a>{225}</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr025">1,483,585 = III Chicchan</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 8</td><td class="pl0">Zac (5 Cauac).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,233,985 = III Chicchan</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 8</td><td class="pl0">Kankin (10 Cauac).</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr025">1,272,465 = III Chicchan</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025">18</td><td class="pl0">Zip (12 Muluc).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The second date in the manuscript is 13 Kankin and the third is 13
  Zip; hence there is one line too many in the former number and one too
  few in the latter. While on page 31a the origin of the numbers belonging
  to the day XIII Akbal seems to be quite clear, here their relation to one
  another is entirely concealed. I must, therefore, refrain from expressing
  any conjecture in regard to them.</p>

  <p>Now the numbers set down in the Manuscript are formed only by the
  addition of the encircled numbers also found there. The encircled number
  for the first expressed number is 51,419, which is the same number we
  found with the corresponding day XIII Akbal; the second has 235 and the
  third 456 = 260 + 196. The 51,419 was 197 × 260 + 199; but 199 is the
  interval from III Chicchan to VII Kan, just as it is from XIII Akbal to
  IV Ik. The 235 is the interval between III Chicchan and IV Ahau and the
  196 that from III Chicchan and IV Imix.</p>

  <p>By the addition of these differences, the numbers written out in the
  Manuscript are obtained<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,483,585 + 51,419 = 1,535,004 (VII Kan).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,233,985 + 235 = 1,234,220 (IV Ahau).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,272,465 + 456 = 1,272,921 (IV Imix).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Keeping in mind what was said in reference to page 31a, let us now
  examine the six numbers and dates collectively.</p>

  <p>The fact that the days IV Ahau and XIII Akbal occur here and
  consequently also III Chicchan is not surprising. Nor is the choice of
  VII Kan and IV Ik an accident, for the interval between these days is
  exactly the same as that between III Chicchan and XIII Akbal,
  viz:&mdash;218 days.</p>

  <p>Hence the distance from III Chicchan to VII Kan is also exactly equal
  to that between XIII Akbal to IV Ik, viz:&mdash;199 days.</p>

  <p>Finally, the distance from VII Kan to III Chicchan is exactly equal to
  that between IV Ik and XIII Akbal, viz:&mdash;61 days.</p>

  <p>IV Imix and IV Kan are separated from the normal date IV Ahau by 3 ×
  13 = 39 and 8 × 13 = 104 days. <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span></p>

  <p>Regarding the encircled numbers, so far as they are independent of
  260, I would note the following<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td><span class="hid">0</span>17 = XIII Akbal to IV Ahau.</td></tr>
<tr><td>121 = XIII Akbal to IV Kan.</td></tr>
<tr><td>196 = III Chicchan to IV Imix.</td></tr>
<tr><td>199 = III Chicchan to VII Kan and XIII Akbal to IV Ik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>235 = III Chicchan to IV Ahau.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>In addition let me remark that 36 = VII Kan to IV Ahau, 39 = IV Imix
  to IV Ahau and 104 = IV Ahau to IV Kan.</p>

  <p>The following arrangement will prove that these numbers were as usual
  also employed to form the large numbers by multiplication<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 17 ×</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 74,620 =</td><td class="pl0"> 1,268,540 (IV Ahau),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025">235 ×</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 5,252 =</td><td class="pl0"> 1,234,220 (IV Ahau),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 36 ×</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 42,639 =</td><td class="pl0"> 1,535,004 (VII Kan),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 39 ×</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 32,639 =</td><td class="pl0"> 1,272,921 (IV Imix),</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025">104 ×</td><td class="ar pl0 pr025"> 12,236 =</td><td class="pl0"> 1,272,544 (IV Kan).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>But the highest number, 1,538,342, was formed in a different way; it =
  59,167 × 26; but the interval from IV Ahau to IV Ik = 182 = 7 × 26, and
  from IV Ik to IV Ahau = 78 = 3 × 26.</p>

  <p>If in conclusion, we now examine the twelve numbers of seven figures
  given in this section, we will clearly see that by twos and twos they
  plainly belong together in pairs<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The three pairs of numbers found by computation are as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,486,923, XIII Akbal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,483,585, III Chicchan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Difference 3338 = 12 × 260 + 218 (VII Kan to IV Ik, III Chicchan to
  XIII Akbal).</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,268,523, XIII Akbal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,233,985, III Chicchan.</td></tr>

  <p>Difference 34,538 = 132 × 260 + 218 (as above).</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,272,423, XIII Akbal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,272,465, III Chicchan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Difference 42 (which is 260 - 218); 42 = IV Kan to IV Imix.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the three pairs specified in the Manuscript are as
  follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 227 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>{227}</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,538,342, IV Ik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,535,004, VII Kan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Difference 3338 = 12 × 260 + 218 as above, by reason of the encircled
  number 51,419 which is common to both numbers.</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,538,342, IV Ik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,535,004, VII Kan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Difference 34,320 = 132 × 260, on account of the same day.</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,538,342, IV Ik.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,535,004, VII Kan.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Difference 117 = IV Kan to IV Imix; strictly speaking 377 = 260 +
  117.</p>

  <p>The upper part of the five columns just now under discussion still
  remains to be examined. Here are five vertical rows of hieroglyphs, the
  first four each containing seven, and the fifth only six owing to lack of
  space.</p>

  <p>The two rows at the top are as usual much obliterated, which is the
  more to be deplored since they consisted of five calendar dates, which
  would have contributed materially to the comprehension of the entire
  section. Fortunately, however, one of these dates is preserved complete,
  and we are able to see in what relation it stands to the rest. Thus we
  find in the third column of page 63 the date XIII Imix 9 Uo. It comes in
  the year 12 Ix and represents the number 1,523,921 (or a number separated
  from it by a multiple of 18,980). Now 1,523,921 = 4175 × 365 + 46 and =
  5861 × 260 + 61. This agrees with the lower number inserted in
  red:&mdash;1,538,342 = IV Ik 15 Zac (12 Muluc), which comes later by
  14,421 = 39 × 365 + 186 and = 55 × 260 + 121. 121, however, is the
  difference between both XIII Imix and IV Ik and the days XIII Akbal and
  IV Kan in the last column of page 62. If we set down with these two
  numbers, those of the normal date just preceding and the normal date next
  following, we have</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,518,400 = 80 × 18980.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,523,921,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,538,342,</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,556,360 = 82 × 18980.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>This is a period of 37,960 = 2 × 18,980 days. It is possible that at
  some future time an indication of such a transition from <!-- Page 228
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>one Katun to
  the other will be found in the writings. Now these two top lines contain
  two dates; on page 62 we find 13 Ceh, and on page 63, 13 Xul, but nothing
  further is to be learned from this than that one or the other of the
  day-signs, 2, 7, 12, 17, must have been set down in the effaced
  indication of the position in the Tonalamatl. All else is obliterated.
  From the third to the seventh row of these five columns it is all
  extremely simple. The third row consists only of five signs for
  beginning, the fourth, of five for end, the sixth of B's sign five times
  and the seventh of the elongated head <i>q</i> four times. But in the
  fifth, two deities alternate, one is apparently male and the other
  female; the god is in columns 1, 3 and 5 and the goddess in 2 and 4; the
  god probably belonging to the days III Chicchan and the goddess to XIII
  Akbal.</p>

  <p>If we look upon this series as the first story of a structure and the
  large numbers just now discussed as the second, then we find the third
  story here, as we shall find it again on page 69. In the passage on page
  31, which is so closely related to the present one, a timid attempt has
  already been made with the number 2,804,100 to erect a third story of
  this kind, which however barely attained to a quarter of the height of
  the one which now engages our attention. If the numbers hitherto examined
  refer to a time not very far from the present, we now come to numbers
  which lie in so remote a future that they can hardly suggest anything
  else than the destruction of the world or a sort of twilight of the gods.
  Nevertheless the starting-point of the whole, the series, which is built
  up with the number 91, <i>i.e.</i>, the Bacab period or the quarter of a
  ritual year, continually comes to view. Indeed, the number of serpents is
  suggestive of this.</p>

  <p>There are four large serpents, which fill most of the space on the
  left half of page 62 and the right of page 61. The two outer ones are
  bluish and the two inner ones white. They rise in several coils, their
  tails below and their heads above. A deity is represented above the
  gaping jaws of each of the four serpents, having apparently been vomited
  up. Above the first and third serpents B is represented in a fashion very
  similar to that which we have already seen on pages 33-35. Above the
  first serpent B has the pouch hanging from his neck and his hatchet is
  held <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page229"></a>{229}</span>downward; above the third he wears the
  pouch and the gala mantle and his hatchet is raised. Above the second
  fourth serpents, on the other hand, there are four-footed animals, but of
  a species not represented elsewhere. They might suggest a (four-footed?)
  walrus and a bear. We have here a double contrast, apparently referring
  to the four cardinal points.</p>

  <p>The veil enveloping this representation would be lifted to a
  considerable extent, if all the eight hieroglyphs written above each
  serpent, were still legible. But, unfortunately, the second group is
  wholly and the third almost wholly effaced, while the first is partially
  effaced and only the fourth is preserved in its entirety. I read these
  groups in the following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar">1</td><td class="pr0 ar">2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">3</td><td class="pr0 ar">4</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">5</td><td class="pr0 ar">6</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar">7</td><td class="pr0 ar">8</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Of these 7 and 8 in the first and fourth groups form the date IX Kan
  12 Kayab, which is in the year 4 Ix; this same date probably occurred
  also in the other two groups. That it is of special importance here, is
  shown by the two columns of hieroglyphs on the left side of page 61,
  where this date occurs again in the lowest place. The last three large
  numbers are not computed from the normal date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu, but from
  this very date and the other five from a similar one. The sixth
  hieroglyph in the first group seems to correspond to the fifth in the
  fourth, since both contain the elongated head <i>q</i>, though with
  different accompaniments.</p>

  <p>In the first group the fourth hieroglyph is the Bacab sign familiar to
  us from pages 51-58, suggesting that the series here is closely connected
  with the one which had the difference 91. The fifth sign of the same
  group is that for <i>beginning</i>, probably to confirm the fact that
  this section begins here. The third sign of the first group is probably
  an Imix, as it is in the first and fourth of the fourth group, combined
  here with the woman's head, which we saw repeated on pages 62 and 63 at
  the top; and over it in the second place of the fourth group is B's
  hieroglyph, which <!-- Page 230 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page230"></a>{230}</span>is also repeated on pages 62 and 63 at the
  top. The third place of the fourth group is occupied by a head, which may
  be C's and which is distinguished by the same kind of circle which on
  page 9b surrounded the Ahau.</p>

  <p>Eight complete dates are set down below the serpents, among which are
  the XIII Akbal already found with the previous large numbers, and III
  Chicchan (repeated three times), and then III Kan (twice), forming the
  beginning and end of the series (page 64), and also III Cimi and III Ix.
  As we shall see directly these are the end dates of the large numbers,
  and Xul = end repeated eight times at the extreme bottom corresponds with
  this. On the other hand, the starting-points must be found by
  computation, with the exception of the date IX Kan 12 Kayab, which is
  actually written down and is the point of departure for three of the
  numbers.</p>

  <p>I will designate the black numbers by <i>a</i> and the red by
  <i>b</i>. Seven of the eight numbers are undoubtedly absolutely correct;
  but I must alter the number 1b, the red number belonging to the first
  serpent. I assume that a line is wanting in the lowest figure,
  <i>i.e.</i>, it should be 8 instead of 3, and that the conspicuously
  large 1 further down on the page serves also as the red number, which
  belongs here. Only one slight change is necessary in the dates on the
  bottom of the pages, which were mentioned above. To the 16 in the date 4b
  I add a dot, and read it 17.</p>

  <p>I will now give a table of the numbers, the starting-points of the
  periods obtained by computation, and the ends of the latter which are
  indicated below the serpents<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>See my treatise, "Die Schlangenzahlen in der Dresdener
  Mayahandschrift" (Weltall, year 5, pages 199-203).</p>

  <p>Several details show how this number-structure forms a definite,
  closely connected whole.</p>

  <p>1. The beginning day in each case is the day Kan, which thereby
  indicates its position as the first.</p>

  <p>2. The last three starting-points are the same; the first three end
  dates, at least, are the same in the Tonalamatl, though not in the
  year.</p>

  <p>3. The two numbers 2b and 4b are exactly the same.</p>

  <p>4. The first three numbers are each divisible without a remainder by
  17, the interval from XIII Akbal to IV Ahau, which was true also of the
  1,268,540 in the second column on page 63, although only this last number
  has anything to do with these important days, of which the other three
  numbers are independent.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, a notable difference between the first serpent and
  the other three is, that the day XI Kan is the starting-point of the
  first and IX Kan of the others. There are, however, 80 days between IX
  Kan and XI Kan. Hence the numbers 2a and 1b are separated from each other
  by 66,640 = 256 × 260 + 80, although they have the same end III
  Chicchan.</p>

  <p>Further it is to be noted that the largest of the eight numbers,
  12,489,781, is separated from the lowest, 12,388,121, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  black number from the red one of the first serpent, by only 101,660,
  <i>i.e.</i>, by not a full one per cent of the entire magnitude. 101,660
  = 5 × 18,980 + 26 × 260 or 391 × 260 or 7820 × 13.</p>

  <p>It is to be noted also that the differences between the black and red
  numbers in the second and third serpents (60,021 and 28,132) are
  divisible by 13 (4617 × 13 and 2164 × 13). They <i>must</i> be, since all
  six numbers refer to the day III.</p>

  <p>Finally the question naturally arises, how did the computer obtain
  these values, <i>i.e.</i>, how was the whole structure built up? On page
  63 we found a 136,864 (not 136,884) set down in <!-- Page 232 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>{232}</span>strikingly small
  characters and crowded between the other numbers, which would remain a
  mystery unless one assumed that it was reserved there for this structure;
  it is 91 × 1504. At first I thought it possible that this 136,864 had
  been again multiplied by 91, the real basal number of this section; for
  we had found a second power once before (on pages 46-50) by computation,
  viz:&mdash;2 × 260 × 260. The result of multiplication in this case would
  be 12,454,624, and the differences between the eight numbers in the
  serpents would be as follows:&mdash;1a + 35,157, 1b <span
  class="nw">-</span> 66,503, 2a + 137, 2b and 4b <span class="nw">-</span>
  60,884, 3a <span class="nw">-</span> 17,814, 3b + 12,318, 4a <span
  class="nw">-</span> 165. But these differences are doubtful, inasmuch as
  they bear no relation to the dates beginning and ending the serpent
  numbers.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, another number contains the desired properties. I
  refer to the 12,412,920, <i>i.e.</i>, it is 109 times the so-called
  Ahau-Katun of 113,880 days, and I believe I have found that the
  Ahau-Katun and its multiples were mostly used in the formation of the
  large numbers. In the following table I have placed this number beside
  each of the serpent numbers, have then found the difference between the
  two and have added to it the interval between the first and last day of
  each serpent number<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Where the serpent number is less than 12,412,920, I have had to place
  the last day before the initial day.</p>

  <p>The work of the Indian computer was, therefore, as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>He took the days for granted. First he determined the differences
  between them; then he added to each difference a multiple of 260; and the
  choice of the multiple seems to have been quite arbitrary. The number
  thus obtained he added to 12,412,920, unless it was the smaller, in which
  case he subtracted it from 12,412,920, and the result he wrote down in
  the serpents.</p>

  <p>We shall find the same process, only somewhat amplified, with the
  serpent on page 69.</p>

  <p>Are the seven numbers intended to denote the destruction of the seven
  planets? I hope this question will be answered in the near future.</p>

  <p>There now remains of the contents of these pages only the two columns
  on the left of page 61, which we will now examine and at the same time
  compare them with the corresponding column of page 69, the upper part of
  which is exactly the same, and the lower very nearly so. Each column
  consists of 18 hieroglyphs, which I count from the top downward,
  designating those of the first column by <i>a</i> and those of the second
  by <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>At the first glance these double columns remind one of the
  inscriptions in the temples and on the stelae, especially of their
  beginnings, the so-called initial series. Here, in the second column, we
  find the statement of the usual periods:&mdash;144,000, 7200, 360, 20, 1,
  but in the first column we find faces belonging to them. In his work "The
  Archaic Maya Inscriptions," 1897, which, on the whole, contains more of
  imagination than of science, J. T. Goodman unqualifiedly declares these
  faces to be numbers by which the periods indicated beside them are to be
  multiplied, and this theory has already found considerable recognition;
  we will therefore try to follow where he leads.</p>

  <p>1a and 1b are effaced on page 61; they probably contained a sort of
  superscription as on the inscriptions. 2a is effaced on page 61, but the
  sign may be recognized from page 69 as that with which on page 46 the
  series of the twenty deities begins after 236 (4 × 59) days. On pages 61
  and 69 it takes the place <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page234"></a>{234}</span>of a face, to which I am inclined to
  assign the numerical value 4. In 2b, which is C's head, I am inclined to
  look for the value 2,880,000 = 20 × 20 × 20 × 360 days, which is not at
  all inappropriate for C, as the sign of the north pole around which
  everything revolves. I therefore propose to read 2ab as 4 × 2,880,000 =
  11,520,000. 3b, it seems to me, resembles the sign for 144,000, which I
  found in the inscriptions and which is repeated in 12a. It must, however,
  be left undecided by what this same number in 3a is to be multiplied; 3a
  is repeated besides in 8a and 13b. 4a contains the head of E, and 4b that
  of the Moan. 4a seems to refer to 5a, and 4b to 5b. But 5a and 5b are the
  same sign, which, inserted between the 144,000 and the 7200, can scarcely
  mean anything else than the so-called Ahau-Katun of 6 × 18,980 = 113,880
  days. Have we two such periods here? Were they designated by consecutive
  numbers? Now comes the 7200 in 6a, and the number 8 with E's head and the
  inserted sign for 360 days in 6b (on page 69 without E's head), therefore
  8 × 360 = 2880. Seler also thinks 7a has the numerical value 16 (Einiges
  mehr über die Monumente von Copan, etc., page 217); 7b belongs to 7a. 7b,
  a Kin with a I and a suffix and a leaf-shaped prefix, is inserted between
  the 360 and 20. What can it mean? Hardly the 260, for this is represented
  elsewhere (<i>e.g.</i>, page 24) by the thirteenth month Mac. Or can it
  possibly refer to the month Yaxkin (days 120-140)?</p>

  <p>8b is a Chuen sign, which, with its prefix (superfix on page 69)
  always denotes twenty days in the inscriptions. It is multiplied with the
  same unknown head in 8a, which we have already met with in 3a. 9a
  contains H's head, and 9b is an unknown head with inserted Kin; the two
  signs must of necessity indicate the single days still to be added to the
  period, though as yet we do not know how.</p>

  <p>The normal date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu then follows in 10ab. If it refers to
  the signs just now discussed, then they must denote a number of about the
  same magnitude as the serpent numbers. 653 or 654 times 18,980 seems to
  suggest itself, but we shall have more to say later on this subject. My
  efforts to reach a definite result here have failed. <!-- Page 235
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span></p>

  <p>Nor does the lower part of the two columns lead me to the desired
  goal. As it seems to consist of several groups, I will first combine 11ab
  and 12ab. I look upon 11a as denoting 20, and with regard to 11b I have
  already expressed the surmise in the Zeitschrift für Ethnologie XXIII,
  page 153, that it may mean 8760 = 24 × 365, <i>i.e.</i>, three
  Venus-solar periods. That would be 20 × 8760 = 480 × 365 = 175,200. The
  Moan in 12a may have the value 13, for this number is so often combined
  with the Moan. As we saw under page 51, 12b is = 18,980; 13 × 18,980 =
  246,740. Accordingly the four signs taken together may mean 421,940 =
  1156 × 365.</p>

  <p>The second group, from 13a to 15b, refers, on the other hand, to the
  year of 360 days. First 13a = 144,000, having in 13b the unknown
  multiplier, which we have already seen in 3a and 8a. Then follows in 14a,
  15 × 7200 = 108,000; in 14b, 9 × 360 = 3240; in 15a, a 20 with a prefixed
  1 (21?); and in 15b, three days. It would be more correct to place the 1
  beside the following 3. The whole sum would then end with the number 4,
  which would agree with the day Kan, the date specified below.</p>

  <p>In the third group the 16a = 19 × 18,980 = 360,620, remains a mystery;
  an empty outline of a sign is added in 16b.</p>

  <p>17ab also forms a group by itself. 17a contains a sign, which rather
  suggests the Bacab, upon whose period of 91 days the series belonging
  here is based. The Imix in 17b with a superfix is still
  unintelligible.</p>

  <p>The columns end in 18 with the date IX Kan XII Kayab, the
  starting-point of the serpent numbers.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 65&mdash;69.</b></p>

  <p>I think it very likely that this section bears the same relation to
  pages 61-64 as pages 46-50 do to 24 and as 53-58 to 51-52. For here, too,
  a period of time forming the basis of the earlier section seems to be
  divided into smaller parts. On page 64 we recognize as the basis of the
  series the number 91, the quarter of the ritual year of 364 days; here we
  have to do with the fourfold division of 91 into 13 unequal parts. And
  the real starting-points on these pages, as on the previous ones, are the
  days III Chicchan and XIII Akbal. <!-- Page 236 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>{236}</span></p>

  <p>The four series of numbers, the top one of which I have probably
  correctly restored from what still remains, are as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>9 XII, 5 IV, 1 V, 10 II, 6 VIII, 2 X, 11 VIII, 7 II, 3 V, 12 IV, 8 XII, 4 III, 13 III.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11 I, 13 I, 11 XII, 1 XIII, 8 VIII, 6 I, 4 V, 2 VII, 13 VII, 6 XIII, 6 VI, 8 I, 2 III.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9 IX, 5 I, 1 II, 10 XII, 6 V, 2 VII, 11 V, 7 XII, 3 II, 12 I, 8 IX, 4 XIII, 13 XIII.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The first two lines, forming together a single period of 182 days,
  refer to a day III, as we see by the ending, and the last two to XIII,
  which undoubtedly refers to the III Chicchan and XIII Akbal, the days so
  significant in the preceding section. Hence an interval of 218 days (III
  Chicchan to XIII Akbal) is to be assumed between the second and third
  lines, with the addition of which interval each of the two periods
  extends over 400 days.</p>

  <p>The first and fourth series have the same difference; and the second
  and third correspond with one another in this respect. In the first and
  fourth the differences follow a rule, viz:&mdash;as if one were walking
  in a ring having on its edge the numbers 1 to 13, and kept stepping
  backward four numbers. The differences of the second and third series
  apparently do not follow any rule. Hence I think that the fourth series
  follows the third by mistake and ought rightfully to precede it. Only the
  fifth member in the first and second series has the same day VIII and the
  day V in the third and fourth series, otherwise the week-days of each
  series differ from those of the others.</p>

  <p>As I regard III Chicchan and XIII Akbal as unquestionably the
  starting-points, I will here give a table of the days on which each of
  the twenty-six members of each series must fall and at the same time I
  will indicate for each day its number from the beginning of the series.
  Accordingly the first 182 days present the following appearance<span

  <p>It would be very essential now to know what place these days occupy in
  the year, and what year is meant; the answer to one of these questions
  would at the same time solve the other.</p>

  <p>Now I think I come nearer to the solution of this problem by assuming
  that the pictures and hieroglyphs refer here only to <!-- Page 238
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>{238}</span>the more
  important of the two days, XIII Akbal, and that III Chicchan is
  represented only by the numbers of the series. Thus both the pictures and
  the hieroglyphs of the two sections connect without the interval of 218
  days, which must be assumed in the case of the numbers.</p>

  <p>Here, as is usually the case of series, we have to begin at the
  bottom. Now the first group of the lower half of page 65 contains the
  sign 9 Kan. If, as it seems, this actually denotes the year, then the day
  XIII Akbal must be the first of the eleventh month, <i>i.e.</i>, the
  201st day of the year. Hence I will again set down the twenty-six dates,
  but add to them the position in the year.</p>

  <p>Let us now prove the correctness of my theory by an examination of
  groups 22 and 23. In 22 the 160th day of this period, the 361st day of
  the year is reached, <i>i.e.</i>, the first of the five Uayeyab days. The
  year 9 Kan is ended and the year 10 Muluc is not yet reached. In the
  corresponding picture we see B occupied in conveying in a bag the image
  of God K to whom belongs the next year. B is armed with the official
  staff and the bag also contains water (rain). In the 23d group the 166th
  day has passed and the second of the year 10 Muluc is reached, which
  gives the name to this year. The first hieroglyph shows two personages
  sitting back to back. This representation is repeated on a larger scale
  below in the Janus picture of B who is sitting on signs of planets. The
  second hieroglyph, with equal fitness, represents a clamp, which is
  intended for fastening two <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page239"></a>{239}</span>objects together, and which is repeated
  twice over the Janus picture, black in one case and white in the other.
  Rain is pouring over the second half of the picture, for it has long been
  known that Muluc and rain belong together, and in our examination of page
  7a we saw that K is the ruler of the day Muluc (6).</p>

  <p>Now, before I begin the examination of the separate pictures and the
  groups of six hieroglyphs belonging to each picture, I wish to mention
  three things which are often repeated here.</p>

  <p>First, B's picture, which appears in all the twenty-six pictures with
  the exception of 20, 24 and 25, and represents the god in the most varied
  positions and activities. These pictures are very similar to those on
  pages 29-46 and we shall therefore make frequent reference to the section
  there represented.</p>

  <p>Second, the first hieroglyph in groups 1 to 13, strange to say, is not
  found in the second half. It is hieroglyph <i>f</i>, which appears in
  exactly the same way in close combination with B in two sections, which
  differ from each other but are placed side by side on pages 30c-39c. In
  the present passage it has a distinct prefix resembling the beak of a
  bird or tortoise, but in the former passage it has rather a stunted
  appearance. It seems to refer to the eagle in B's hands in group 13.</p>

  <p>Third, the head with no underjaw, which is the sixth hieroglyph in
  groups 1 to 13, but does not occur in groups 14 to 26. It is repeated in
  a very similar fashion in the last hieroglyph but one on page 23b. I
  propose to attribute to it the meaning of fasting.</p>

  <p>Now for the single groups<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. B is seated rowing in a boat, as he is represented also on pages
  29c, 36b, 40c and 43c. A creature is swimming beneath him, which may be a
  crocodile. The fifth hieroglyph is the important 9 Kan already discussed,
  the fourth is <i>a</i> and the second the cross <i>b</i> combined with
  Caban. The day is the 210th of the year.</p>

  <p>2. B is walking with the atlatl in his hand, and armed with javelins.
  Hieroglyph 5, Manik, denotes the chase, but has a prefix, which often
  seems to have the meaning of 20. 2 is the elongated head <i>q</i> with
  the prefix of the east belonging to the Kan years. 4 is a Moan sign (c)
  with the leaf-shaped prefix. Does <!-- Page 240 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>{240}</span>this perhaps denote the
  slaying of game in the forest? It is remarkable that B's feet are hidden,
  as if he were walking in sand or in a bog.</p>

  <p>3. B is walking, carrying a large stick like that for tilling the
  field, as on pages 38b and 39b, and he bears a carrying-frame; there are
  footprints below him. Hieroglyph 2 is the compound of the signs for south
  and east, 4 (<i>r</i>) may denote rain, and 5 is two elongated heads with
  an unknown prefix.</p>

  <p>4. B, is seated on astronomical signs as on page 37c. The copal pouch
  is hanging from his neck and he is brandishing his hatchet. Sign 2 is
  <i>b</i>, 4 is <i>a</i> and 5 is <i>r</i>, but all three signs have
  unusual prefixes; the first of these prefixes appears again in the tenth
  group, 41 days later.</p>

  <p>5. B is seated on a head, probably that of D, which, however, is
  peculiar owing to the ornaments resembling bunches of grapes in place of
  both the eye and the ear (compare pages 39c and 41a). I do not venture to
  decide what he holds in his hand nor what are the other objects which he
  carries. Sign 2 is <i>r</i> with a prefix, 4 is Imix perhaps with a knife
  as a prefix, 5 is the skeleton which sometimes belongs to the lightning
  beast, but also to the 14th month; its prefix is unknown.</p>

  <p>6. B is seated on a support, which contains two cross-bones, down to
  which he points with his right hand, while his left hand holds the
  hatchet on his knee. Sign 2 is the crouching naked personage, with the
  cross <i>b</i> prefixed, 4 is the elongated head with a prefixed Yax, and
  5 is Kan with a vessel as a prefix (instead of Imix) from which steam or
  froth is rising. The day is the 234th of the year, <i>i.e.</i>, the end
  of a week of 18 × 13 days.</p>

  <p>7. B is sitting on a tree at the root of which his own head appears
  (compare with this the representations on pages 31c, 33c, and especially
  40a, and also 41b and 42b). The second sign is Yax with a prefix; 4 is
  Kin within which there is a 1, as is several times the case, for example,
  on pages 61 and 69. The fifth sign is still a mystery to me. The day here
  is V Manik. Do the hieroglyphs suggest that the interval from the day IX
  Kan, which gives the name to the year, to V Manik is exactly the same
  <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>{241}</span>as that from the normal date IV Ahau to
  the true starting-point of our passage, the day XIII Akbal? Both
  intervals are 243.</p>

  <p>8. B is seated in a house, on the roof, wall and floor of which are
  several Caban signs, just as on page 30a; he seems to be pointing
  forward. Sign 2 is Caban with a prefix, the 4th and also the 5th is Kan
  with two unusual prefixes.</p>

  <p>9. Water is pictured at the bottom of this picture, and in it are a
  fish, a mussel and a snail (possibly page 37b may be compared with this).
  There seems to be a suggestion of footprints on the margin of the water,
  back of which B is walking, his legs hidden as far as the knees. He holds
  the hatchet uplifted in his left hand and his right holds what may be a
  long-stemmed aquatic plant (compare page 42b). Sign 2 is composed of
  <i>b</i>, Imix, the mouth and nose of C and the object which apparently
  is a beak, previously met with in sign 1. 4 is Kan-Imix, and 5 is Kan
  with prefix and suffix.</p>

  <p>10. B is seated in an expectant attitude, his hands resting on his
  knees. We see a very similar representation of him on page 38a, where he
  faces himself, and in general the remaining pictures of that passage
  furnish a striking parallel to the present one. Sign 2 is a head (E's?)
  with a call seemingly issuing from its mouth. 4 is the elongated head
  <i>q</i> with the Ben-Ik superfix and an unusual prefix, which we found
  on page 66c prefixed to the cross <i>b</i>; 5 is Kan with the same
  prefix, which I regarded as denoting a call in sign 2, and which is
  probably answered here by an affirmative cry.</p>

  <p>11. The expectation has been fulfilled. B is seated on a mat holding a
  woman in the same position as on page 38a. Sign 2 is the cross <i>b</i>
  with the prefixed beak as in 1, and also with another prefix, which seems
  sometimes to denote the number 20. 4 is exactly the same Kin with 1 and
  the leaf-shaped prefix, which occurred in the same place with the seventh
  picture. 5 contains the sign for 73 days; a new period of this length
  begins here on the 74th day.</p>

  <p>12. As in the parallel passage on page 38 B seems to be offering a
  Kan, so here his gift consists of a kind of wreath, like the one in the
  fifth picture; he is seated on astronomical signs, which contain the
  cross <i>b</i> twice as does also hieroglyph 2. 4 is <!-- Page 242
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span>Kin-Akbal, and
  5 is a Kan with the prefix which generally belongs to the south as a
  superfix.</p>

  <p>13. B is seated on the elongated head <i>q</i> with a superfix and a
  prefix, exactly as on pages 37c and 40a, and this sign is repeated in the
  hieroglyphs (in 2) just as it is in the two former places. He holds the
  eagle on his lap and we see him connected with the same bird in a
  different way on page 43c. Is B represented here as the preventer of
  evil? Hieroglyph 4 is <i>a</i>, while 5 is Kan, apparently with the sign
  of the south as a prefix. A Bacab period of 91 days ends here. We come
  now to the upper series of pictures.</p>

  <p>14. B is walking in the rain, with the copal pouch around his neck and
  the hatchet uplifted in his left hand. An unknown object, possibly held
  in his right hand, is hanging in front of his legs. Hieroglyphs 1 and 3
  are effaced, 2 is indistinct, 5 seems to be a Xul (end, close) and 6 is
  E's head.</p>

  <p>15. B is walking, brandishing the hatchet in his left hand, and
  holding in his right an object resembling a cornucopia filled with fruit;
  below this hangs what appears to be a flower. The god wears the copal
  pouch. Hieroglyph 1 is a hand holding K's head; it is curious that this
  sign should also occur in the next group as an indication of the
  approaching Muluc year. 3 is a sign still undetermined; but the prefix is
  the crouching naked personage with dots suggesting stars around its head.
  I have often thought that similar figures represented Mercury; it is
  remarkable that exactly the 115th day of this section is reached here,
  corresponding with the apparent revolution of Mercury = 115 days.
  Similarly sign 2 invites computation; it is a face resembling an Ahau
  sign, with a 3 as a superfix and a 9 as a prefix; compare the other
  places containing the same face, with 33c. After the fashion of the
  inscriptions this would denote 9 + 3 × 20 = 69, which by the way is three
  fifths of the Mercury revolution. 5 is a compound of Akbal and Imix and 6
  a compound of a Moan sign (<i>c</i>) with <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>16. B is in a half sitting position and holds a strange object before
  himself. On top of his own head is K's, which is repeated in sign 2. I do
  not know how to explain 1, unless it is the bat-god; 3 is a Xul = end
  (but of what?) combined with Imix, <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>and 5 is the usual
  Kan-Imix. 6 is a Kin with an 8 back of it (as 36b, 37b, 67a, 68a) and
  over it is a hand pointing to the right, just like those in groups 20 and
  25. This looks as if we ought to count forward 8 days, but what can be
  the purpose of doing so?</p>

  <p>17. B is walking armed with spear and shield. Sign 1 is <i>b</i>, 2
  the face resembling an Ahau, which occupied the second place in group 15,
  3 is probably Xul again, but with an effaced prefix; of 5 also only an
  Imix remains; while 6 is the usual compound of Muluc-Caban.</p>

  <p>18. We have now reached the day 16 Kayab, a day very close to the day
  18 Kayab, which on page 24 we recognized as an especially important day,
  while in my article "Zur Entzifferung III" I regarded it as the day of
  the summer solstice. Computed from the normal date IV Ahau 8 Cumhu it may
  also have denoted the end of a lunar year, as on pages 51-58 where it is
  the basis of the series. The picture here agrees with this. B is sitting
  in the pouring rain of the rainy season and gazing upward at the planets,
  as on page 36c and particularly on 39c; the sun and moon are also
  represented, but below the planets. The hieroglyphs likewise contain the
  sun and moon in 1 and 2, in 3, Ahau and Xul with a prefix, as if this
  were the end of the increase of the sun's power; 5 is Kin-Akbal, day and
  night, and 6 is Caban with the cross <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>19. B is walking armed with hatchet and shield. He holds a serpent in
  his hand as on page 40c, but here with the head downward. Hieroglyphs 1
  and 2 are destroyed, 3 is the cross <i>b</i> with a suffix and the
  horse-shoe prefix <i>e</i>, known to us from pages 5 and 6. 5 is Imix
  combined with Chuen and probably with Yax, and 6 is E's head.</p>

  <p>20. This is the old red woman with the tiger claws, whom we saw on
  pages 39b and 43b and shall see again on page 74; she reinforces the
  water falling from the planets by pouring a stream from her jug. The
  first three hieroglyphs are effaced, 4 is the elongated head <i>q</i>, 5
  is Kin-Akbal, 6, as in group 16, is again the enigmatical 8 with a hand
  pointing to the right.</p>

  <p>21. B is walking and bears pouch, spear and shield. <!-- Page 244
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>{244}</span>Hieroglyph 1
  is a hand holding the sign of the rising Moan, just as in 15 a hand holds
  the head of K; 2 is again K, whose sign is probably effaced several times
  in the last groups of this series. 3 is E with the sign of the east; 5 is
  compounded of Imix, Chuen and <i>b</i>, and 6 is Kin with the sign of the
  north. Here the day of the normal date is reached, but this may be
  significant only for the year 9 Ix.</p>

  <p>22. We come now to the representation of the change of the year, which
  we have already mentioned. Hieroglyph 1 is curious, consisting of the
  moon with a stripe running around it like a strap; 3 and 5 are not clear
  to me and are doubtless closely connected with one another; 3 also
  contains a trace of K and is perhaps a determinative of the same. 6 is
  again E, and suggests the tilling of the fields.</p>

  <p>23. This picture as well as the first two hieroglyphs have already
  been discussed above. The crouching personage, repeated again in 3 as a
  prefix to the cross <i>b</i>, is curious. 5 is again E and 6 is Imix,
  referring to grain and honey.</p>

  <p>24. The picture and three of the hieroglyphs plainly correspond. The
  grain deity E holds food and drink in his hand. Rain is pouring from the
  planets, and the wind-beast plunges down, as on pages 44 and 45. Sign 3
  is E's hieroglyph, 6 is Kan-Imix and 2 is the wind-beast. B is
  superfluously added in 4 and the same is true of the cross <i>b</i> in 1,
  while Kin-Akbal in 5 seems to fit almost everywhere. Pages 29a, 30a and
  45c show the lightning-beast in a different form.</p>

  <p>25. As is usually the case, rain is pouring from the stars and below
  them are the sun and moon as before. This time C is sitting in the rain,
  clad in the gala mantle and holding Kan. Hieroglyphs 1, 2 and 4, the
  latter apparently representing C, are effaced. The other three are
  enigmatical, 3 is again Xul with a prefixed 9, 5 a Caban, but with an
  unintelligible prefix, and 6 is again the mysterious 8.</p>

  <p>26. B is sitting on a tree or sacrificial stone, which is colored half
  blue and half red, and may denote the ceasing of the rainy season; he is
  brandishing his hatchet. Hieroglyphs 1, 2 and 3 <!-- Page 245 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>{245}</span>are effaced; 4 is B's
  sign, 5 might be Xul and 6 is <i>a</i> with <i>c</i> added and thus
  referring to the Moan. And here the half of the ritual year ends with the
  182nd day, which is XIII Chicchan 18 Pop (10 Muluc); and it is left to
  the reader to imagine or to find hieroglyphs and pictures for the other
  two series of numeral signs.</p>

  <p>I am troubled about the five naked crouching figures of this section,
  which I am inclined to regard as the sign for Mercury with its apparent
  revolution of 115 days, which, however, seems sometimes (as on pages 54,
  56 and 58 in the upper sections) to be raised to the value of half a
  Tonalamatl = 130 days. This may be explained by the fact that it is
  difficult to determine exactly the length of the revolution of Mercury.
  In group 15 this figure appears exactly on the 115th day of this section,
  but in group 6 on the 234th day of the year, <i>i.e.</i>, approximately
  at the expiration of two Mercury periods after the beginning of the year.
  But now for group 23. Here there are three of these crouching figures.
  The two upper ones leaning back to back must serve the purpose of
  indicating the change in the year. But they would hardly do so, if the
  third personage were not added, which may indicate that the solar year
  consists approximately of three Mercury periods. I look upon this view of
  the matter merely as the first attempt at an explanation.</p>

  <p><b>Pages 69&mdash;73.</b></p>

  <p>The chief subject of the last great section of this Manuscript is two
  of the usual series, from which large numbers are developed in the usual
  way and the largest of all is finally recorded in a serpent. This section
  thus forms a parallel to the contents of pages 61-64, but is somewhat
  more composite.</p>

  <p>Before I begin the discussion of these series, I wish to examine two
  passages, which I think are not connected with these series, but are
  independent, like the instance on pages 51-58, where the hieroglyphs were
  found to be quite independent of the numerals. The Mayas took advantage
  of space wherever it presented itself, which is admissible in ideographic
  writing.</p>

  <p>The first of these two passages is at the top of pages 71-73. <!--
  Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>Here
  there are four horizontal rows of twelve hieroglyphs each. Since,
  however, the top row is entirely effaced and none of the other three are
  perfectly preserved, it is quite impossible at present to judge of the
  interconnection of the whole. But I must point out a certain resemblance
  to the passage on pages 44b-45b, where a period of 78 days is considered
  with reference to the wind-deities. The first and sixth columns of pages
  71-72 likewise contain the signs for wind and the pierced ears. The fact
  that the Bacab sign occurs in the eighth column, and in no other, must
  attract 'attention; if we knew it to be effaced in the first column, then
  each column might refer to 13 days, though 12 × 13, it is true, does not
  form a natural whole. C's sign is the only hieroglyph of a god to be
  found in both passages. E also occurs on pages 44b-45b and may be one of
  the effaced signs on pages 71-72. There is no trace left of the others.
  The fact that some hieroglyphs occur in both the passages referred to
  proves nothing with regard to signs in frequent use and I can find no
  cases of correspondence among those occurring more rarely. Hence this
  passage must be left for the present as an almost complete mystery.</p>

  <p>I have discussed the second passage in detail in my article "Zur
  Entzifferung der Mayahandschriften V," of the year 1895, and from it I
  will borrow the following. This second passage fills the middle and lower
  thirds of pages 71-73, occupying the same space as the first passage in
  the upper third, and offering far more reliable material than the
  latter.</p>

  <p>That these hieroglyphs are not connected with the numerals above and
  below, can be deduced from the fact that the numbers follow one another
  from right to left and the hieroglyphs in the reversed order. This is
  proved by the hand pointing to the right, which occurs here at least
  eight times like the one occurring twenty times on pages 46-50.</p>

  <p>But the scribe, misled by the direction of the numeral series, began
  on page 71 to write the <i>first</i> of these hieroglyphs from the right
  instead of from the left, but after the first four groups he corrected
  his mistake. Hence I read the groups of three hieroglyphs each, in the
  following order<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span> <!-- Page 247 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>{247}</span></p>

  <p>The number 28 shows that we have to do here with 28 weeks of 13 days
  each, <i>i.e.</i>, with a ritual year of 364 days, as was the case on
  pages 31-32, 63-64 and 65-69. This year, however, is divided into four
  parts of 7 x 13 = 91 days, <i>i.e.</i>, into four so-called Bacab
  periods. This is very plainly indicated here, for groups 4, 11, 18 and
  25, <i>i.e.</i>, those separated by seven groups each, are exactly alike,
  but in group 4b (I will designate the three hieroglyphs of each group
  from top to bottom by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>) there is a
  prefixed 4 which refers to the four Bacabs as does the same 4 prefixed to
  the Bacab sign at the top of page 72.</p>

  <p>Now the question arises as to when this ritual year began. Undoubtedly
  its beginning day was very different from that of the civil year (360
  days) and from that of the astronomical year (365 days).</p>

  <p>In this matter I follow Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, who has rendered such
  estimable service to Aztec science. At the Congress of Americanists at
  Stockholm in 1894, she submitted an article entitled "Note on the Ancient
  Mexican Calendar System," in which with keen discernment she pointed out
  a year beginning with the spring equinox and including in its centre the
  sacred Tonalamatl, <i>i.e.</i>, 260 days, which were preceded and
  followed by 52 days. I recognize this ritual year also in the present
  passage of the "Dresdensis," as the one current in the Maya country. It
  probably began about the 10th of March, at that period about the time of
  the vernal equinox, according to the Julian Calendar.</p>

  <p>Beginning with this date, I will now attempt to tabulate the
  chronology of this passage. In the first column I will place the number
  of the group of hieroglyphs in question, in the second I will set down to
  what day of the Maya year each group refers; in the third, the
  corresponding day of our year, and finally in the fourth, the 20-day
  periods which agree in general with the dates. <!-- Page 248 --><span

</table>

  <p>In the following I will call attention to a few points by which this
  arrangement is justified.</p>

  <p>Hieroglyph 1a admits of explanation. It consists of four
  parts:&mdash;the left top is Kin, meaning sun or day, the right top is
  the sign of the year, the right bottom is the knife as symbol of
  separation or division, and the left bottom, which is especially
  decisive, is the month Ceh. Hence I read 1a thus:&mdash;the day of the
  change of year in the month Ceh. The sign 1b is the <!-- Page 249
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>familiar
  Kin-Akbal signifying either the beginning day or the day Akbal. If the
  year should be named from this sign, then this would mean a Kan year, as
  in the preceding section the beginning lay in the year 9 Kan. If the year
  in the latter section had been as equally divided as the one in question
  here, it would have furnished us with some very remarkable parallels.</p>

  <p>Again the four groups:&mdash;4, 11, 18 and 25, which are alike, are
  important. The cross in sign <i>a</i>, combined with the three dotted
  lines passing from top to bottom, may refer to the wind and this meaning
  is further confirmed by the Ik sign (wind) in <i>c</i>. Further the sign
  <i>b</i> between them is that for the Bacab, the wind deity itself.</p>

  <p>The most important events of the year are obviously the sowing and
  harvesting of the maize together with the beginning and end of the rainy
  season. Now we find the first two in connection with the god E, the
  maize-god, who is represented in 6c and 13c, 91 days apart, corresponding
  to the end of May and the beginning of August. Generally speaking, sixty
  days only were reckoned as the time between sowing and reaping, but here
  a quarter of a year may have been taken as a round number and it may also
  have reference to a more elevated region.</p>

  <p>I am inclined to think that the beginning and end of the rainy season
  are referred to in signs 8c and 16c, where, as it seems to me, three
  lines of drops are falling from a rectangle denoting the sky (as is
  usual) like the representation of rain dropping from a cloud at the
  bottom of page 36 (second picture). The serpent 8b as symbol of water may
  also refer to the same thing, especially as it is combined with an Akbal
  (often denoting beginning). The sign, which I think denotes the rainy
  season, is very similar, but not the same as another one, which is common
  to the Dresdensis and Tro-Cortesianus, the significance of which is
  certainly very close to the idea of the week of 13 days.</p>

  <p>I have some other ideas on this subject, which, however, are mere
  conjectures, advanced with some hesitation. If the Chuen sign in 7a is
  actually a serpent's jaw, then it might refer to the beginning of the
  astronomical year in May, since the serpent so often designates that
  time. <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span></p>

  <p>In 9b we find a crouching figure with the sign which is usually
  considered that of the death-bird. In another place (Zur Entzifferung IV,
  12) I have regarded the naked human figure placed upside down on page 58
  as the sign for Mercury, and on page 60 at the bottom, left, I also
  regarded the crouching figure as representing Mercury vanquished by
  Venus. But in 9b, which belongs to the 105th-117th days of the year, a
  115 day revolution of Mercury is computed. A crouching figure, like that
  in 9b, likewise appears on page 65a in the second series of 91 days after
  11 + 13 = 24 days of this series have elapsed, <i>i.e.</i>, directly
  after the 115 days of the apparent revolution of Mercury.</p>

  <p>In 10b, and it is the only place in this passage, we find the
  hieroglyph of B, the leading god of this Manuscript. This corresponds
  with the time of the greatest power of the sun and of the change in the
  civil year (July 16th). In Group 12, do <i>a</i> and <i>c</i> mean the
  year and is <i>b</i> the head with the Akbal eye, thus denoting the
  beginning of the civil year? It ought really to have formed group 11, but
  there was no room for it, since it was necessary that the signs for the
  period of 91 days should be set down there.</p>

  <p>Signs 14a and the combined signs 15bc are almost alike and suggest 1a.
  Is it intended to designate here the ritual year, the time of the
  autumnal equinox (September 10th?). In 15a two hooks, turned in opposite
  directions proceed from one side of the sun-glyph. Do they signify two
  halves of the year and does the 3 in front of them signify the third
  quarter of the year?</p>

  <p>20b is the sign of the death-god A, probably not placed accidentally
  here at the end of the month Xul, which denotes the end; but the end of
  what?</p>

  <p>The hieroglyph in 23a is a black bird, with two hooks, one pointing up
  and the other down, projecting from its head. Usually these hooks belong
  to K, and by means of them this bird becomes the storm-bird; the year
  symbol is below. Does this hieroglyph signify the time of the shortest
  day, when darkness predominates?</p>

  <p>A peculiarity of this passage is the striking frequency of the <!--
  Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>{251}</span>sign
  looked upon as that of the death-bird as well as of the cognate sign,
  which is commonly considered as that of the rising Moan. The first bird
  is in the 14th group, in the 9th it is combined with the apparent Mercury
  sign, and in the 17th with the year sign. The second bird with the
  prefixed Yax is in the 2nd group. But it is especially striking that
  several times both signs, and this is the case nowhere else, are combined
  into a single sign in groups 9, 13 and 26 and also probably in 19 where,
  however, the Moan sign seems to be effaced.</p>

  <p>This is all I have to say at the present time in reference to this
  calendar. Some of my statements are positive and some are only
  conjectures. Compare my treatise "Zwei Hieroglyphenreihen in der
  Dresdener Mayahandschrift" (Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 1905, 2 and
  3).</p>

  <p>Having disposed in this way of the two supplementary subjects of this
  section, I will now proceed to consider the principal theme,
  viz:&mdash;the two series and whatever is connected with them.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">1. The 54-Series of the Day IX Ix.</span></p>

  <p>As with the other series, we begin here at the right, <i>i.e.</i>,
  with page 73. There in the last column we find the superscription as it
  were. It is true that nothing positive can be gathered from the top part
  consisting of five hieroglyphs, which are mostly destroyed. The third
  hieroglyph seems to be the sign in group 2a discussed above. The fourth
  is an Akbal with a prefixed arm as on pages 8a, 36a, and the fifth is an
  Ik with a prefix.</p>

  <p>Below these are three numbers:&mdash;14,040, 702 and 54, which are in
  the proportion of 260, 13 and 1, so that the 14,040 is a Tonalamatl, as
  it were, of 260 periods of 54 days each. The fact that 54 is chosen here
  as the difference of the following series is curious, because usually
  only parts of 260 or of 364 are selected. But 54 is probably only a
  secondary matter, while 14,040, with its marvellous property of
  divisibility into the most varied and important periods, is the chief
  subject.</p>

  <p>There is a 9 in a red circle under the three numbers. It is <!-- Page
  252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>{252}</span>meant to
  denote the starting-point of the series, the day IX Ix. Perhaps these two
  as well as the 54 are connected with the 9 "señores de las noches."</p>

  <p>In passing on to the left, I shall not consider the hieroglyphs and
  numbers in the next two columns in the upper third, since they are only
  set down here in order to secure space for them. They will be discussed
  later.</p>

  <p>The series itself begins in the upper third of page 71, in the next to
  the last column; it is continued on page 72 and on page 73 as far as the
  third column. The first twelve numbers are written from left to right
  contrary to the usual practice, doubtless occasioned by the passage above
  the series, which has already been discussed. And below, again contrary
  to rule, we find not the week and month days, but only the week days and
  they are in red circles. If written in the usual way, the series would
  have the following form (with the usual omission of the initial day IX
  Ix)<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The series must now continue with the 702 already specified on page
  73, which it proceeds to do from right to left in the middle of page 71,
  and continues from there on with regularly added dates and with the 702
  itself as the difference. At the same time, since 702 = 54 × 13, the
  week-days are forced to come to a standstill on the IX, while each of the
  month days ascends by two (702 = 35 × 20 + 2). The 4914 = 7 × 702 is
  obtained in the next to the last column of page 70. On page 71 the 702 is
  incorrectly set down as 1. 15. 2. instead of 1. 17. 2. The series
  continues on page 71 in the same way beyond the 702, until in 7020 a
  number is obtained which is also divisible by 260, so that now the
  accompanying day must be IX Ix. Now we ought to expect to see here the
  double of 7020, the very 14,040 abovementioned, but it is omitted just
  because it was set down on page 73. Nevertheless this very number forms
  the new <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page253"></a>{253}</span>difference with which the series returns
  from page 70 to the top line of page 71, where the numbers are mostly
  effaced, but enough remains to enable us to assume that the last number
  on page 71 is the 10th multiple of 14,040, and this may be followed by
  the 11th and 12th multiples, the last number being 168,480.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">2. The 65-Series of the Day IV Eb.</span></p>

  <p>This series begins in the middle of page 73 with the day IV Caban, the
  zero-point therefore being IV Eb. It then advances to the left across 28
  members, until on page 71 it reaches the number 1820 = 5 years of 364
  days = 7 Tonalamatls. From there on, 1820 itself is the difference, and
  the accompanying day therefore remains IV Eb. Then, in the two lowest
  sections of pages 71 and 70, the fourth multiple of 1820, <i>i.e.</i>,
  7280, is the third difference and thus the series advances to 15 × 7280 =
  109,200 on page 71, after which on page 70 the omitted 8 × 7280 = 58,240
  is written out. Close beside this number are the figures 1. 0. 12. 3. and
  a 0 below the latter, which was not successfully erased; this would be
  the number 7443 of which I can make nothing at all.</p>

  <p>The initial dates of the two series, IX Ix and IV Eb, are 138 days
  apart and reversely 122 days.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">3. The Groups of Hieroglyphs.</span></p>

  <p>The transition, as it were, from the series to the large numbers is
  formed by a few groups of hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>The first of these groups is at the top of pages 69-70; its first top
  line is completely effaced. The remainder I will designate by the
  following numbers<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">

<tr><td class="ar" colspan="5">12</td><td class="pr0 ar">16</td><td class="pl0">.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The date IX Kan 12 Kayab, set down under 3 and 4 does not belong there
  but to the serpent below and will be discussed later.</p>

  <p>I take sign 1 to be that of a Bacab, 2 I do not understand and it is
  half obliterated; it seems to occur again on page 73 <!-- Page 254
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>in the column
  to the extreme right. 3 and 7 are the elongated head <i>q</i> with an
  unusual superfix, 4 and 8 correspond with one another, but I cannot
  explain them. 5, 10 and 14 denote the beginning, 6, 11 and 15, the end. 9
  and 13 both designate the 8th day of the month Kayab and over them IV
  Ahau must have been set down twice. 12 and 16 are two heads of gods, 12
  is probably D's with the sign for west and 16, B's with that of the
  east.</p>

  <p>On page 70, in the middle of the third and fourth columns, the day IX
  Ix occurs twice. In one case it ought to have been IV Eb and the scribe
  has really changed the IX to IV, but he omitted changing the Ix to Eb.
  Directly below these dates we find the second group, consisting of two
  rows of four hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>I think these eight hieroglyphs can be interpreted as follows<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="pr2"> 1) 13 Pax</td>
<td> 2) 20 Pop or 25 Cumhu</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> 3) VIII Ahau</td>
<td> 4) 13 Yaxkin</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> 5) 10 Muan</td>
<td> 6) 37,960</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> 7) 20</td>
<td> 8) 1 Zec.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The following is to be noted in this connection<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>3 is really set down X Ahau, but an VIII is written above the Ahau by
  way of correction. The day VIII Ahau will presently prove to be
  important.</p>

  <p>6, a compound of Imix and the superfix denoting multiplication, is the
  sign for 18,980, and its prefix seems to me to denote duplication. We
  have long known how important the 37,960 = 146 × 260 = 104 × 365 is, and,
  if my theory is correct, we shall see directly that it occurs again
  here.</p>

  <p>8 seems really to be 1 Zec, but the composite prefixes demand further
  examination.</p>

  <p>Impenetrable darkness still shrouds the meaning of the whole group.
  Though it is clear that in several cases certain days are specified
  according to their position in the year, their distance apart does not
  agree with the interval between days IV Eb, IX Ix and IV Ahau under
  discussion here.</p>

  <p>If signs 3 and 4 ought to be read together as VIII Ahau 13 Yaxkin,
  then this date would come in the year 7 Muluc. In the Zeitschrift für
  Ethnologie I explained the five hieroglyphs <!-- Page 255 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>{255}</span>in the third column at
  the bottom of page 70 (the third group) as civil years of 360 and
  astronomical years of 365 days<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>This, it is true, is a striking explanation and certainly a surprising
  one!</p>

  <p>Now the date IX Ix 12 Kayab is at the very bottom of the fourth
  column. This, without apparent reason, would refer to the year 4 Kan.
  Should it not be read IX Kan 12 Kayab (4 Ix), thus indicating that the
  entire passage is only the preparation for the date from which the
  serpent numbers proceed? The scribe may have had in mind the IX Ix of the
  series.</p>

  <p>The fourth and last group on page 73, above the two numbers 83,474 and
  34,732, consists of four hieroglyphs. The two upper hieroglyphs on the
  left are effaced, and the top one on the right. I think it probable that
  the day VIII Ahau, which will be discussed later, may have stood in the
  top line, and possibly with a month date. Of the two remaining signs of
  the fourth group, the upper is the moon and the lower Imix, probably with
  the hieroglyph of the east as a prefix; but there is nothing to be done
  with it owing to the obliteration of the sign above it. In the
  Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 1891, page 153, I have endeavored to explain
  these three signs on the right above 34,732, by suggesting for them the
  values</p>

  <p>and calling special attention to the fact that between IV Eb and IV
  Ahau there are 208 days, and that the 34,732 placed below them in the
  Manuscript, increased by 208, is equal to 34,940. <!-- Page 256 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>{256}</span>This group then seems
  really to belong to the day IV Eb and to the 65-series, while manifold

  groups.</p>

  <p>Two of the numbers and two of the dates are conjectural<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>I read the 1,202,240 as 8. 6. 19. 10. 0. while the Manuscript has 16
  instead of 6. I read the 101,812 as 14. 2. 14. 12. the Manuscript has 16
  instead of the second 14. And in two places in the third column of page
  70, I have restored the day IV Eb, where the Manuscript incorrectly
  repeats the IX Ix, and does the same thing on page 73.</p>

  <p>Let us now first consider the construction of those large numbers,
  which are connected with the day IX Ix and thus with the 54-series. These
  numbers are the two upper ones of columns 1 and 2 and the lower one of
  column 1 on page 70.</p>

  <p>174 is the starting-point, the number of the day is IX Ix, which seems
  to have been chosen because it divides the Tonalamatl approximately in
  the proportion of 2 to 1. (IV Ahau <span class="nw">-</span> IX Ix =
  174.)</p>

  <p>The 5359th, 5520th and 4619th multiples of 260 have been added to 174;
  why precisely these multiples were chosen <!-- Page 257 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>{257}</span>remains a mystery. In
  this way were obtained the following numbers, which the Manuscript
  suppresses. I will give them with their corresponding dates<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,393,514 = IX Ix 12 Muan (5 Kan).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,435,374 = IX Ix 17 Chen (3 Cauac).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,201,114 = IX Ix <span class="hid">0</span>7 Mac (11 Muluc).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>When we add to the above the three encircled numbers 606, 1,646 and
  86, the resulting sums are the three numbers found in the Manuscript<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,394,120 = IV Ahau <span class="hid">0</span>8 Chen (7 Ix).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,437,020 = IV Ahau 23 Cumhu (7 Cauac).</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,201,200 = IV Ahau 13 Kayab (11 Muluc).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>I am placing the first two not far from the present and the third in
  the past.</p>

  <p>As multiples of 260 these three numbers have the following form<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,394,120 = 5362 × 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,437,020 = 5527 × 260.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,201,200 = 4620 × 260.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Some curious facts come to light with regard to their magnitude and
  their mutual relation.</p>

  <p>The two largest numbers are 165 × 260 = 660 × 65 apart; this recalls
  the 65-series. The third lowest number is 165 × 7280 and thus contains
  not only the 65 but = 165 × 65 × 112.</p>

  <p>The ritual year (364) and its excess over the Tonalamatl (104) is
  likewise contained in these numbers, at least in the first and third<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td>1,394,120 = 3830 × 364 = 13,405 × 104.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,201,200 = 3300 × 364 = 11,550 × 104.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The three encircled numbers are connected with one another because the
  first = 2 × 260 + 86, the second = 6 × 260 + 86 and the third is 86
  itself. The larger encircled numbers are, therefore, 1040 = 4 × 260
  apart, and this is also the interval between the two numbers near the
  bottom. 1040, however, also = 5 × 208, and 208 is the interval from IV Eb
  to IV Ahau. Now it is curious that the two numbers below are 5775 × <!--
  Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>{258}</span>208
  and 5780 × 208, though the third belongs to day IX Ix and the fourth to
  IV Eb. One result of this is that 1,201,200 = 1155 × 1040 and 1,202,240 =
  1156 × 1040.</p>

  <p>As these three numbers relate to day IX Ix and the 54-series, so the
  fourth relates to IV Eb and the 65-series.</p>

  <p>Here the starting-point is the number 52, which belongs to day IV Eb
  and this is separated from IV Ahau by 208 days <i>i.e.</i>, it divides
  the Tonalamatl in the proportion of 1 to 4.</p>

  <p>To the number 52 then, for unknown reasons was added 4623 × 260 =
  1,201,980, and thus the number 1,202,032, suppressed in the Manuscript,
  was obtained for the day IV Eb. To this sum the encircled number 208 was
  then added and the result was 1,202,240, the number in the
  Manuscript.</p>

  <p>The number = 23,120 × 52 = 4624 × 260, which is self-evident, but it
  also = 5780 × 208, <i>i.e.</i>, it is a multiple of the encircled number.
  It consequently also = 11,560 × 104, and thus it is related to the first
  and third numbers just now discussed.</p>

  <p>The position of this number is IV Ahau 18 Kankin (1 Kan) and the
  position of the suppressed number is IV Eb 10 Zotz (also 1 Kan).</p>

  <p>We ought now to discuss the last two numbers of this section amounting
  to millions:&mdash;1,567,332 and 1,520,654, which are in the third and
  fourth columns at the top of page 70. But before going further, we must
  examine four other numbers, two of which, 111,554 and (with my
  correction) 101,812, are in column 4 on the lower part of page 70, and
  the other two, 83,474 and 34,732, are on the top of page 73. Although
  these four numbers are not ornamented with circles, they all have the
  significance of the numbers enclosed in circles and are designations of
  differences between suppressed and specified numbers.</p>

  <p>Let us first of all examine their curious relation to one another<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The Manuscript should have set down under these numbers the day IX Ix
  twice and IV Eb twice, from which days the numbers in question must be
  computed; but here the two errors already mentioned were made. <!-- Page
  259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>{259}</span>111,554
  <span class="nw">-</span> 101,812 is 9742, the very same number which we
  shall afterward find as the difference of the serpent numbers on page
  69.</p>

  <p>83,474 - 34,732 = 48,742. If 9472 be subtracted from this, the
  remainder is exactly 39,000 = 150 Tonalamatls = 50 revolutions of Mars. I
  have already found this number on page 31a, and also the double of it,
  78,000, on page 24, and this I found by using 68,900 + 9100 for my
  computation.</p>

  <p>111,554 - 83,474 = 28,080, <i>i.e.</i>, exactly the double of the
  important 14,040, which is recorded on page 73.</p>

  <p>101,812 - 34,732 = 67,080, <i>i.e.</i>, = 258 Tonalamatls or 86
  revolutions of Mars.</p>

  <p>111,554 - 34,732 = 76,822; if 122, the interval from IV Eb to IX Ix be
  subtracted from this, the remainder is 76,700 = 295 Tonalamatls.</p>

  <p>101,812 - 83,474 = 18,338; if 138, the interval from IX Ix to IV Eb,
  be subtracted from 18,338, the remainder is 18,200 = 70 Tonalamatls = 50
  ritual years of 364 days each, <i>i.e.</i>, exactly the double of the
  9100 specified on page 24.</p>

  <p>Now we also have the following equations for the four numbers<span
  class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 111,554</td>
<td class="pl0"> = 429 × 260 + 14.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 34,732</td>
<td class="pl0"> = 133 × 260 + 152.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>A day VIII Ahau is 14 days back of the day IX Ix, and another VIII
  Ahau is 152 days back of IV Eb.</p>

  <p>Thus a day VIII Ahau hitherto unmentioned is introduced into the
  computations. This day has no doubt been chosen, because it divides the
  Tonalamatl beginning with IV Ahau into two parts of 160 and 100 days,
  which are in the proportion of 8 to 5, <i>i.e.</i>, the same proportion
  as the Venus year to the solar year.</p>

  <p>This day VIII Ahau may also figure in the large numbers of the first
  two columns on page 70, for 1,394,120 and 1,201,200 are both divisible by
  14, the interval between VIII Ahau and IX Ix. <!-- Page 260 --><span

  <p>The last record of the date of VIII Ahau seems to throw light on the
  date 13 Pax (page 70, column 3), which is directly above the date VIII
  Ahau, and which I have already mentioned in the discussion of the groups
  of hieroglyphs.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it seems as if a day VIII Ahau occurred a fifth time in that
  passage, for in consequence of the correction made by the scribe we read
  here VIII Ahau 13 Yaxkin. This would <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>point to a year 7
  Muluc, the position of which between the other four is, of course,
  undetermined.</p>

  <p>If the two large numbers in the Manuscript were treated in the same
  way as the other large numbers, they would not be recorded at all, but
  instead of them there would have been two numbers belonging to the day IV
  Ahau and under them would have been the encircled numbers 208 and 86, or
  these numbers increased by a multiple of 260. This passage would then
  read about as follows<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 1,567,540</td>
<td class="pl0 pr2"> (IV Ahau)</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 1,520,740</td>
<td class="pl0"> (IV Ahau)</td></tr>
<tr><td class="ar pr025"> 208</td>
<td class="pl0 pr2"> (IV Eb)</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 86</td>
<td class="pl0"> (IX Ix).</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>These two numbers for IV Ahau are equal to 6029 and 5849 Tonalamatls.
  If 5549 × 260 be subtracted from these, the remainders are 480 and 300
  Tonalamatls respectively, <i>i.e.</i>, 124,800 and 78,000, and these are
  in the proportion of 8 to 5.</p>

  <p>Now the two large numbers have the difference 46,678 = 179 × 260 +
  138; the latter is the interval from IX Ix to IV Eb.</p>

  <p>The four numbers of the days VIII Ahau seem to stand in very irregular
  relation to one another and yet they show the following striking results,
  if the first and third and also the second and fourth numbers be combined
  (as I combined them under page 24)<span class="nw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>In the first case we see the following<span

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">5. The Serpent.</span></p>

  <p>As in the section occupying pages 61-64, the single series is crowned
  by four serpents with eight large numbers, so in this section the two
  series end in a single serpent with two numbers, one for each series, but
  both bear some obscure relation to the day VIII Ahau, which has made its
  appearance here. The two <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page262"></a>{262}</span>sections also correspond, inasmuch as the
  numbers in both are computed not from the normal date, but from the date
  IX Kan 12 Kayab (4 Ix).</p>

  <p>The serpent pictured here is different from the previous ones,
  inasmuch as it is partly black. The god B is sitting on its opened jaws,
  and this time he, too, is painted black (as on page 31c); there is an
  animal's head upon the god's head, in which we again recognize that of
  the animal with the fourth serpent in the preceding section. The god is
  armed with spear and shield and recalls his picture at the bottom of page
  74.</p>

  <p>There are eight hieroglyphs above this picture, just as there are over
  each of the first four serpents. The two top hieroglyphs are obliterated.
  Of the legible hieroglyphs, the one at the left top is the Bacab sign,
  which also occurs over the first of the four serpents. In the third line
  are the same two hieroglyphs, which are in the third line of the first
  and second columns on page 70. The first of the two also occupies the
  same place on page 62 above the fourth serpent. But here at the bottom we
  find the date IX Kan 12 Kayab (4 Ix), the same date which we found over
  the fourth serpent, which is thus again brought into closer connection
  with the single serpent.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt here regarding the two numbers in the serpents,
  but notice should be taken of the fact that the figure 1 is barely
  visible in the red number.</p>

  <p>The black number here has the figures 4. 5. 19. 13. 12. 8. and the red
  4. 6. 1. 0. 13. 10. The black is therefore 12,381,728, and the red
  12,391,470. The black number is somewhat less than the eight numbers in
  the four serpents, and the red is somewhat larger than the least of
  them.</p>

  <p>The difference of the two is 9742 = 37 × 260 + 122; but 122 is the
  interval between days IV Eb and IX Ix. Now this is the same 9742 which we
  found on page 70, as the difference between 111,554 and 101,812.</p>

  <p>In order not merely to examine these numbers, but also to understand
  them, we will again make use of 109 Ahau-Katuns = 12,412,920, as we did
  in the first four serpents, and we shall have the following<span

</table>

  <p>The date given for both numbers was the day IX Kan, which was likewise
  the starting-point for six of the eight numbers in the previous
  serpents.</p>

  <p>Besides this the day IV Eb, the starting-point of the 65-series, is
  given for the black number, and therefore also the interval between IV Eb
  and IX Kan = 252.</p>

  <p>To this 252 was added a multiple of 260, not an arbitrary choice, but
  one which combined with 252 resulted in a number divisible by 8, the
  interval from IX Kan to IV Eb. 31,192 = 3899 × 8 = 119 × 260 + 252 was
  thus obtained.</p>

  <p>The subtraction of this number from 12,412,920 resulted in the serpent
  number 12,381,728.</p>

  <p>In addition to all this the day IX Ix, the starting-point of the
  54-series, is given for the red number; consequently also the interval
  between IX Ix and IX Kan = 130, which, at the same time, is reversely the
  interval from IX Kan to IX Ix.</p>

  <p>To this 130 was added a multiple of 260, which <i>must</i> in every
  case be a multiple also of 130. Thus we obtain the 21,450 = 82 × 260 +
  130.</p>

  <p>The subtraction of this number from 12,412,920 results in the serpent
  number 12,391,470.</p>

  <p>Reckoned from the starting-point IX Kan 12 Kayab (4 Ix) the black
  number corresponds to the date IV Eb 5 Chen (10 Muluc) and the red to IX
  Ix 12 Zip (11 Kan), and these two dates must certainly have been under
  the serpent; the months unfortunately are effaced.</p>

  <p>It is self evident that the black number is exactly divisible by 8 and
  the red by 130.</p>

  <p>The two events indicated by the two numbers must be to some extent
  coincident with the beginning of the seven events recorded in the
  previous four serpents. These large numbers pertaining to the destruction
  of the world are a reminder of the <!-- Page 264 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page264"></a>{264}</span>numbers, which on page
  24 we believed were connected with the creation of the world. Thus here,
  too, we have the genesis and the apocalypse of all the mythologies.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="gesperrt">6. The Columns of Hieroglyphs.</span></p>

  <p>The last portion of this section is formed by the two middle columns
  of hieroglyphs on page 69. They bear an extraordinary resemblance to
  those discussed under page 61 even in regard to the fact that each column
  contains 18 signs. Besides, the upper 10 lines, <i>i.e.</i>, the upper 20
  signs, are exactly alike on the two pages, aside from slight variations,
  and differ only in so far as the passage on page 69 is written on blue
  ground and the one on page 61 on white.</p>

  <p>But also the lower part, with eight signs in each column, shows many
  points in common with page 61. Here as there the whole is divided into
  several groups.</p>

  <p>With the four signs 11ab and 12ab, which formed the first group there,
  I can compose only the two signs 11ab here. In the cross 11a, as on pages
  24 and 58 of the Manuscript, I see the sign for 20 with the prefixed 5
  making 25. In 11b we find the sign for 18,980 days, which we have already
  met with several times. Hence 11ab would have the value of 25 × 18,980 =
  474,500 days, as on page 61 the corresponding four signs seemed to form
  421,940. And as the number there was 1156 × 365, so on page 69 we have
  1300 × 365.</p>

  <p>I believe there is a disarrangement in what follows, inasmuch as I
  assume that the two signs 12b and 13a ought to be placed <i>before</i>
  and not <i>after</i> 12a. Assuming that the two little crosses on either
  side of the 1 are meaningless, we should assign the value of 61 to the 3
  Chuen, 1 Kin. Here, in the first place, the intention seems to be to
  establish some connection with the two days VII Kan and IV Ik specified
  with their numbers on page 63, column 3, as well as with the days most
  important there, III Chicchan and XIII Akbal, <i>i.e.</i>, a connection
  with the previous section of the four serpents in general; for the
  interval from VII Kan to III Chicchan, as well as that between IV Ik and
  XIII Akbal is 61 and on pages 70-73 the two most important days, IV Eb
  and IX Ix, are 122 days apart, and 122 is the <!-- Page 265 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>second multiple of 61.
  I can now put the 144,000 of 12a in the place of the 13a. Then, secondly,
  the four signs from 13a to 14b in the one section are exactly like those
  in the other section, and therefore need not be discussed here. Only 15ab
  differs from the signs in the other passages inasmuch as on page 69 we
  find 4 × 20 + 4 × 1. The last 4 agrees even better than it does there
  with the distance from IV Ahau to the day Kan with which the serpent
  numeral begins.</p>

  <p>Nothing on page 69 corresponds to the signs in 16ab and 17ab of page
  61. On the contrary, the initial date of the serpent IX Kan 12 Kayab,
  which on page 61 does not appear until 18ab is set down in 16ab. On the
  other hand on page 69 the four signs 17ab and 18ab are added, 17a being a
  sign as yet unknown with 13 as a superfix. I feel inclined, though with
  many misgivings, to treat 17ab like 5a and b of page 61 and to assign to
  them the value of an Ahau-Katun of 113,880 days. For then they would
  denote the 13th Ahau-Katun, which extends from the day 1,366,560 (page
  24) to 1,480,440 and which contains the two large numbers on page 70,
  left, top, while the two lower numbers in the first and second columns of
  that page belong to the 12th Ahau-Katun, and the two in the third and
  fourth belong to the 14th Ahau-Katun. The 13th would be the present and
  the 12th and 14th the past and future; but all this could only be
  confirmed by further research. At all events, the signs for beginning in
  17b and for end in 18a refer to past and future. Unfortunately, 18b is
  entirely effaced.</p>

  <p><b>Page 74.</b><a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Besides the picture, this page contains only 15 hieroglyphs in three
  horizontal rows. Only about six of these signs are decipherable. The
  second, third and fourth of the lower line are three different heads; the
  middle is the familiar head of god B, the one on the left has the Akbal
  eye and the abbreviated sign for the south, which is repeated in the
  affix; the head on the right has the sign for the west as a prefix. Very
  little more is to be said of the other hieroglyphs than that the second
  and third of the second line have the sign for the east; the first of the
  <!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page266"></a>{266}</span>second line, however, was the one which we
  found on pages 71-73 as the constant companion of the Bacabs and which
  suggested the wind. The last sign of the second line must have contained
  that for north, so that the four cardinal points all came together
  here.</p>

  <p>The picture begins below these signs. Astronomical figures, apparently
  Venus, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, end in the fore part of a crocodile.
  Below the astronomical signs are the signs for the sun and moon. Streams
  of water are falling from the jaws of the crocodile and also from the sun
  and moon. And a fourth stream is being poured from a jug by the old woman
  with the tiger claws, and with the serpent on her head, whom we saw on
  pages 39, 43 and 67 engaged in the same occupation. Cross-bones are
  represented on her skirt as the symbol of death. The sign of the ninth
  day, Eb, appears on the jug; this is the day which was avoided in the
  Tonalamatls, for not a single Tonalamatl begins with Eb in the
  Dresdensis, nor does one begin with the week-day IX; does Bolon meaning
  nine suggest Balam, the jaguar?</p>

  <p>Still further down on the page sits a black god, who may be the same
  as the god on pages 7a and 16b, with a bird of prey on his head. There
  are two arrows in his right hand and his left hand holds what may be an
  atlatl, but it is very much longer than is usually the case; at the same
  time it can be regarded as a spear.</p>

  <p>This page can denote nothing but the end of the world, for which the
  serpent numbers have prepared the way. Perhaps what looks like a zero
  above the sign Eb in the stream of water may likewise point to this
  calamity.</p>
